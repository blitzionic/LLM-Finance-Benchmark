**Example Question**: Explain the process of calculating the net present value (NPV) of a project.

**Answer**: The net present value (NPV) is calculated by discounting the future cash flows of a project to their present value using a discount rate, typically the project's cost of capital, and then subtracting the initial investment. The formula is:
\[
NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t} - C_0
\]
where \( C_t \) is the cash inflow at time \( t \), \( r \) is the discount rate, and \( C_0 \) is the initial investment.
