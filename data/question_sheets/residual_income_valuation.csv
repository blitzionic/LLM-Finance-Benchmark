The residual income is given by:
= Net operating income - (minimum required rate of return * average operating assets)
= $40,000 - (15% * $180,000)
= $40,000 - $27,000
= $13,000","Residual Income: In the context of Finance and accounting, one can have different forms of income such as gross profit, net operating income, net income or residual income depending upon the stakeholders' or analyst's requirement. The residual income is usually the income meant for the shareholders once all the expenses are met."
2,"Assume that Clampett, Inc., has $290,000 of sales, $240,000 of cost of goods sold, $150,000 of interest income, and $130,000 of dividends. What is Clampett, Inc.'s excess net passive income?",0,"137,500","187,500","280,000",D,"The correct answer is option (d).
The total Clampett, Inc.'s excess net passive income is $280,000.
Explanation:
The total Clampett, Inc.'s excess net passive income is $280,000 ($130,000 + $150,000), which is the sum of the interest income and dividend income.",Passive Income: Passive income is the income other than the operating income which a company or an individual does not earn in a regular course of business. This type of income does not come from the operating activity of the company or entity.
3,The division's residual income is closest to:,"$575,100","$1,175,100","$(1,980,900)","$(24,900)",D,"The calculated value of division's residual income is option
d. ($24,900)
.
The division's residual income is given by:
= Net operating income - (minimum required rate of return * average operating assets)
= $575,100 - (12% * $5,000,000)
= $575,100 - $600,000
= -$24,900","Residual Income: In the context of accounting, the residual income for a firm or a division is the income generated in excess of the minimum return required by the investors such as shareholders and debt holders. The minimum return is governed by the required rate of return which in turn is determined by using the formula for weighted average cost of capital."
4,"Two companies, A and B, have the same ROEs, but Company A has a higher residual income. Which of the following would explain this, all else equal?",Company A is riskier than Company B.B. Company A has a higher expected future growth.C. Company A has a greater net book value.D. Company A has a lower ROA.,,,,C,"(C.) Company A has a greater net book value.
Net book value is the amount of assets over liabilities for an organization. The accounting formula of A = L + E will show us that if A is much greater than L, than E will be higher under Company A. Because ROE is the same, income is higher, resulting in a higher residual income.",Residual Income: Residual income is the amount of income in excess of a rate of return off the organization's assets. Assets are used to generate income and in return profit. Residual income will give you a monetary value of how much over the required return you are earning for profit.
5,Which of the following is a measure of a manager's performance working in an investment center?,Residual income.,Return on investment.,Divisional income statements.,All of these choices are correct.,D,"The correct option is
d. All of these choices are correct.
The residual income measures the amount of income that the divisional manager has generated over and above the required income. The higher the residual income, the better the performance of the manager.
The return on investment measures the divisional net income as a percentage of investment in the division. The higher the return on investment the better the performance of the manager.
The divisional income statements shows the divisional net income and help in comparing the performance of investment centers.
Hence all options are correct.",Performance Evaluation: Business needs to evaluate their investment centers to generate decent returns for the investors. Businesses use different evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of their divisional managers.
6,"If ROI for a division is 15% and the company's minimum required cost of capital is 18%, then:",residual income for the division is negative.,residual income for the division takes on a value between zero and positive one.,residual income cannot be computed.,EVA must be negative.,A,"The correct answer is
a. residual income for the division is negative.
Residual income is operating income minus required return. If return on investment is lower than the required return, the residual income is negative because of a lower return than what is required.",Residual Income: Residual income is used to measure the profitability of a specific investment. It evaluates the performance and if the investment would increase or decrease the value of the company.
7,The performance of the manager of Division A is measured by residual income. Which of the following would increase the manager's performance measure?,Increase in average operating assets,Decrease in average operating assets,Increase in minimum required return,Decrease in net operating income,B,"Answer: B. Decrease in average operating assets
An increase in the manager's performance measure would result to an increase in the residual income. Residual income is computed as follows:
Net operating income
XXX
Average operating assets
XXX
X Minimum required rate of return
XXX
Required return on investment
XXX
Residual income (Net operating income - Required return on investment)
XXX
As indicated in the formula for computation above, the residual income would increase if there would be a decrease in average operating assets minimum required rate of return, or an increase in net operating income.","Residual Income Residual Income is the excess of the operating income for a specified period over the expected amount of return from the amount invested, using a defined required rate of return."
8,Residual income is:,Net operating income plus the minimum required return on average operating assets.,Net operating income less the minimum required return on average operating assets.,Contribution margin plus the minimum required return on average operating assets.,Contribution margin less the minimum required return on average operating assets.,B,"Correct Answer:
Option b) Net operating income less the minimum required return on average operating assets
.
Residual income is the profit over and above the normal profit. It is the profit above the minimum required return. We use the following equation to determine the residual income:
Residual income = Net operating profit after taxes - (Average operating assets Ã— Minimum required return)",Operating Income: Operating income can be computed by reducing the operating expenses from the gross profit. It accounts for the nonoperating expenses like interest and taxes. Both gross profit and operating income are reported on the income statement.
9,Economic income is equal to residual income.,True,False,,,B,"The above statement is false.
Reason: Economic income refers to the income generated through increase in the market value of the assets of the company while residual income can be defined as the income that business generate continuously after finishing its operating activity.",Income: Income can be defined as the money earned by any business entity against the product or service provided to the customer. Income earned by the company is used in the day-to-day operations of the business entity.
10,What can be said if a division generates a positive residual income?,Performance was above expectations.,Operating income exceeds the division's minimum return.,Profitability was greater than that of other divisions in the company.,Asset turnover was very high.,C,"The correct answer is
Operating income exceeds the division's minimum return.
{eq}\begin{align} \text{Residual Income} &= \text{Net Operating Income} - (\text{Average Operating Assets} \times \text{Minimum rate of return})\\ &= \text{Net Operating Income} - \text{Division's Minimum return}\\ \end{align} {/eq}
Hence, the residual income shows how much excess a business division generates over the desired minimum return.
Explanation for incorrect answers
The comment on profitability and asset turnover can be made by using the DuPoont analysis and not by the residual income metric; hence options (c) and (d) are incorrect.",Residual Income: Residual Income is a performance evaluation metric that is used to compare the performances of different investment centers of the business. The residual income compares the operating income and the minimum return.
11,What is the formula for residual income?,Income from operations * Minimum Acceptable Income from Operators.,Income from Operations/Invested Assets.,Minimum Acceptable Income from Operations - Operating Expenses.,Income from Operations - Minimum Acceptable Income from Operations.,D,"The correct answer is option d. Income from Operations - Minimum Acceptable Income from Operations.
Residual income is a financial metric used to measure the profitability of a business unit, department, or individual investment, taking into account the minimum acceptable return on the invested capital. The formula for calculating residual income is as follows:
Residual Income = Income from Operations - Minimum Acceptable Income from Operations
The components in the formula are explained below.
Income from Operations: It refers to the operating income generated by the business unit, department, or investment, exclusive of any financing costs or extraordinary items.
Minimum Acceptable Income from Operations: It is the minimum required return or profit that the company or investor expects to receive from the invested capital. It is calculated by multiplying the invested assets by the required rate of return (also known as the cost of capital or hurdle rate).","Investment Center: In management accounting, an investment center is a business unit or division within an organization responsible for generating its revenues, controlling costs, and making decisions related to asset investments."
12,"If operating income is $43,000, average operating assets were $215,000, and the minimum required rate of return is 12%, what is the residual income?","$60,200","$8,600","$17,200","$25,800",C,"The correct answer to the above is Option C. $17,200
Explanation
Operating income = $43,000, Average operating assets = $215,000, minimum required rate of return = 12%
Residual Income = Operating income - (Average operating assets * minimum required rate of return)
Residual Income = $43,000 - ($215,000 * 12%)
Residual Income = $43,000 - $25,800
Residual Income = $17,200","Residual Income In the contemporary world, people look not only for the net income and EPS of a company but also for efficiency. The residual income approach is one of the ways by which the efficiency of a company can be found."
13,Most organizations use the only residual income for performance measurement because of the weaknesses associated with using return on investment (ROI).,True,False,,,A,"The statement is true.
In comparison to return on investment, residual income is a preferred evaluator of performance because measurement issues related to the asset base are removed. Also, divisions with a high ROI will not reject attractive investment options.
Using an ROI to evaluate a unit's performance leads to investment decisions that are based on an unrealistic economic model.","Residual Income The sum of operating profit left after all capital expenses for producing revenues have been paid is described as ""residual income."" It is the net income an investment generates after deducting the required return on its operating assets."
14,Projected disposal or residual values of replacement equipment are relevant to capital investment analysis because:,they represent future cash inflows and usually differ among the alternatives.,they represent future cash inflows.,they usually differ from the alternatives.,they reduce income taxes.,A,"The answer is
a. they represent future cash inflows and usually differ among the alternatives.
Assuming that the asset will be sold at the end of its useful life, Residual Value is the expected selling price. Therefore, a future cash inflow. Residual Value also differs in different alternatives.","Residual Value: Residual Value is the amount the company expects to sell an asset after its useful life. It is also called salvage value. In computing for depreciation, the initial cost of asset less the salvage value will result to a depreciable amount."
15,Given the following data:,"$19,200",$0,"$18,000","$13,200",D,"The residual income would be $13,200 (d)
The calculation for residual income is shown below.
Residual income = (Sales * Margin) - (Average operating assets * Minimum required rate of return)
Residual income = ($240,000 * 10%) - ($60,000 * 18%)
Residual income = ($240,000 * 0.10) - ($60,000 * 0.18)
Residual income = $24,000 - $10,800
Residual income = $13,200",Residual Income: Residual income is a profit calculation method that is the difference between revenue and capital expenditures made to generate the revenue. Residual income = (Sales * Margin) - (Average operating assets * Minimum required rate of return)
16,"Assume that Division P has achieved income from operations of $160,150 using $1,041,140 of invested assets. If management desires a minimum rate of return of 11%, what is the residual income?","$45,625",$23,"$94,649","$160,150",A,"Correct Answer:
Option A. $45,625
.
The first step is to determine the minimum required return:
Minimum required return = Average investment in assets Ã— Minimum required rate of return
Minimum required return = $1,041,140 Ã— 0.11
Minimum required return = $114,525
The next step is to determine the residual income for division P:
Residual Income = Net operating income - Minimum required return on assets
Residual Income = $160,150 - $114,525
Residual Income = $45,625","Residual Income: When a business earns profits above the required return, the excess profits are referred to as residual income. Residual income is also called economic profit. Residual income can be computed using the assets, operating income, and cost of capital."
17,Given the following data:,"$11,700",$0,"$18,000","$20,300",A,"The correct option is a.
To calculate the residual income, we use the net income for the year and the minimum required net income. We must use the information provided to calculate the net income before we can apply the residual income formula, and we can do it in one of two ways:
Sales revenue
$290,000
Margin
9%
Net income = $290,000 Ã— 0.09
$26,100
OR
Return on investment
29%

$90,000
Net income = $90,000 Ã— 0.19
$26,100
Now we are ready to use the formula
Average operating assets
$90,000
Minimum required rate of return
16%
Minimum required net income = $90,000 Ã— 0.16
$14,400

18,Which of the following is the correct formula for calculating residual income?,Weighted Average Cost of Capital - Net Operating Profit After Tax,Operating income - Minimum acceptable operating income,Historical cost of assets - Accumulated depreciation,Operating income + Average assets,B,"Let us discuss each alternative:
a. Weighted Average Cost of Capital - Net Operating Profit After Tax
No. The weighted average cost of capital or WACC is a percentage and it does not make sense to subtract NOPAT from that percentage.
b. Operating income - Minimum acceptable operating income
This is the correct option. The minimum acceptable operating income is calculated using the average assets and the WACC. This amount is then deducted from the actual operating income to calculate the excess or residual income.
c. The historical cost of assets - Accumulated depreciation
No, this will give us the book value of the assets.
d. Operating income + Average assets
No, this calculation will not result in any useful amount. Operating income Ã· Average assets is one formula used to calculate ROI","Responsibility Accounting: Responsibility accounting is an accounting system used to report on the results of segments of large companies.

37,Use the following information to compute residual income:,"$32,160.","$10,800.","$50,700.","$10,200.",D,"Correct Answer:
Option d. $10,200
.
The first step is to determine the investment in assets:
{eq}\text{Average investment in assets} = \dfrac{\text{Operating income}}{\text{Return on investment rate}} = \dfrac{\$51,000}{15\%} = \$340,000

{/eq}
Now, we can determine the residual income using the following formula:
Residual income = Operating income - (Average investment in assets Ã— Cost of capital)
Residual income = $51,000 - ($340,000 Ã— 12%)
Residual income = $10,200",Residual Income: Residual income is the economic profit realized over the expected returns.  The expected return is the return that a company should achieve to compensate its financing sources.  Residual income indicates healthy business growth.

Option c) $257,000
.
We can determine the average invested assets as follows:
Residual income = Operating income - (Required return Ã— Operating assets)
On interchanging the equation:
(Required return Ã— Operating assets) = Operating income - Residual income
Operating assets = ($34,000 - $13,440) / 8%
Operating assets = $257,000","Residual Income: Residual income is the economic profit that the company earns from its assets, and it represents the difference between the operating income and the minimum return expected on the assets."

44,"Residual income (RI) is a performance evaluation that is used in conjunction with, or instead of, return on investment (ROI). In many cases, residual income is preferred to ROI because:","With RI, desirable investment projects will not be neglected by high return divisions.",RI is easier to compute than ROI.,"RI is a measure over time, while ROI represents the results for one period.",RI concentrates on maximizing a percentage return rather than absolute dollars of income.,A,"Let us discuss the alternatives:
A. With RI, desirable investment projects will not be neglected by high-return divisions.
This is the correct option. Because residual income uses a bench-mark return, divisions will be keen to accept any investment opportunity that beats the requirement, and not only those that offer super-large ROIs.
B. RI is easier to compute than ROI.
No, the opposite is probably true. To calculate Residual Income, you need the entity's cost of capital, and this can be complicated to calculate.
C. RI is a measure over time, while ROI represents the results for one period.
No, both measures apply to one period only.
D. RI concentrates on maximizing a percentage return rather than absolute dollars of income.
No, this is true of ROI.
