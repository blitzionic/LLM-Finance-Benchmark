A
.Option A is correct because the time value of money suggests that the money that is presently available is more valuable than it will be in the future. This is because inflation reduces the quantity of a good that can   be purchased using the same amount of money over time. Even if the money is deposited in a bank where it can earn interest, it will be worth more the sooner it is withdrawn. This can be seen by considering the following formula: {eq}\text{FV}=\text{I}\times {{\left( 1+\text{R} \right)}^{\text{t}}}

{/eq}
B
.Option B is incorrect because ""the interest rate effect of money"" creates an impact on the 'borrowing and spending' of an individual. At a lower interest rate, individuals and businesses tend to borrow money, which increases the money supply in the economy. At a higher interest rate, there is less money in the hands of the individuals and businesses, so the money supply decreases.
C.
Option C is incorrect because the ""present value of money"" is the current worth of a future amount of money at a given rate of return. Its value helps an individual decide whether to accept or reject an offer. It can be calculated using the formula: {eq}\text{PV}=\frac{\text{FV}}{{{\left( 1+\text{r} \right)}^{\text{t}}}}

D
.D.Option D is incorrect because the immediate value of money refers to the payment of equal amount received at an equal time interval.","Value of monet The value of money refers to the purchasing capacity of an individual.

19,Increases in the stock of capital are the result of decreases in:,gross investment,depreciation,net investment,all of the above,B,"Answer
B.
is correct. Increases in the stock of capital are the result of decreases in depreciation.
The capital stock measures the level of physical capital at the end of a fixed term (usually the level of physical capital at the end of the year). The inflows  or additions to this stock are called (gross) investments. In turn, the outflows are called depreciation and measure the amount of physical capital that wears out over the term and can not be used in the production process any longer. Depreciation of capital is a natural process as most machines, tools or items will break over the term of their lifetime. Net investments are the difference between gross investments and depreciation.
If depreciation decreases,  net investments will ceteris paribus increase.","Physical Capital and Investments In economics, physical capital is defined as all tool and items that can be used in the production process to create output. The creation of physical capital is called investment. Although physical capital is usually measured and denoted in monetary units it is important to note that physical capital is not money."

b. Decrease to less than $10 billion
.
We know that there is an inverse relationship between the interest rate and investment spending in the economy. This is so because a rise in the interest rate causes the cost of borrowing to rise, which in turn, reduces the level of investment spending in the economy.
In this case, the interest rate rises from 2% to 5% then it will cause the investment spending to decline from $10 billion. So, it can be stated that the investment spending would decline from $10 billion as an outcome of an increase in the interest rate from 2% to 5%.",Interest rate: The term interest rate in economics can be depicted as a rate charged by the lender from the borrower above its principal amount of loan being taken.

The present value decreases as either the discount rate or the number of periods per year increases, other things held constant.  This is because increases in either of these factors will result in a more pronounced discounting effect.",Present Value vs. Future Value: The present value is an amount today.  The future value is the present value compounded into the future at a pertinent rate of interest.  Discounting that future amount back to the present (at the same rate of interest) will yield the present value.

Explanation:
As per the data:
Future value, FV = $6,000
Interest rate, i = 3%
Time period, n = 15 years
Computation:
Present value = FV / (1 + i)^n
Present value = $6,000 / (1.03)^15
Present value = $3,851.17

50,The sum of the present values of all cash flows (inflows and outflows) is called:,the payback cost.,internal rate of return.,net present value.,required rate of return.,A,"The correct option is a).
Let us discuss each alternative:
a) the payback cost.
No. The payback period is a formula used to calculate the number of years it would take to recover the initial cash investment.
b) internal rate of return.
No. the internal rate of return is the discount rate that must be used to arrive at discounted annual cash flows that equal the initial investment.
c) net present value.
This is the correct alternative. We calculate the net present value by first determining the cash flows for each year of a project's life, then discounting those cash flows using the required rate of return, and then adding the results to arrive at the net present value.
d) required rate of return.
No, this is the discount rate used to calculate the present values of all cash flows.","Present Value of Cash Flows: The present value of a cash flow is the value in today's money of an amount that will be received in the future. It is calculated by taking the cost of money into consideration, and it is always less than the future cash flow (unless interest rates are negative)."

First, the Value of $100 deposited for four years will be calculated:
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{Accumulated amount}} &= {\rm\text{Annuity}} \times \left( {\frac{{1 - {{\left( {1 + {\rm\text{i}}} \right)}^{ - {\rm\text{n}}}}}}{{\rm\text{i}}}} \right)\\

& = \$ 100 \times \left( {\frac{{1 - {{\left( {1 + 0.09} \right)}^{ - 4}}}}{{0.09}}} \right)\\

& = \$ 323.97

\end{align*}

{/eq}
Now the present value of this accumulated amount would be calculated using the PV formula:
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{FV}}& = {\rm\text{PV}}{\left( {1 + {\rm\text{i}}} \right)^{\rm\text{n}}}\\

\$ 323.97 &= {\rm\text{PV}}{\left( {1 + 0.09} \right)^2}\\

{\rm\text{PV}} &= \$ 272.68
