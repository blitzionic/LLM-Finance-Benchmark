3,The failure of an individual to have a will can result in which of the following?,I only,II only,Both I and II,Neither I nor II,C,"The correct choice is option c. Both I and II.
When a person declares legally that he or she intends to get his or her assets distributed in a certain way or wishes something to happen in a certain way after his or her death, it is known as a ""will."" It can be canceled or changed only when the person is alive.
A will specifies the people who can get a share of their inheritance.
I. Favorite relatives who are supposed to be included in the will by the testator cannot get an inheritance as they are not legally bound to receive an inheritance in the case of no will.
II. A testamentary gift is a gift given by a person to charity after his or her death. In the case of no will, these gifts cannot become effective.
Therefore, both statements I and II are true.","Estate planning (EP) An EP is the procedure in which the assets of a person are managed and distributed after the occurrence of death or incapacitation of the person. The assets should be preserved before they are distributed. As part of planning, the EP has certain tasks to perform, such as making a will as per the preferences of the person."
4,Estates:,seldom have Second Tier beneficiaries.,"unlike trusts, are not subject to the Tier System.",nearly always have First and Second Tier beneficiaries.,nearly always have Second Tier beneficiaries.,C,"Option (c) is correct.
Estates have First and Second Tier beneficiaries is the correct answer.
First-tier beneficiaries: It involves those beneficiaries to whom income is to be distributed at present.
Second-tier beneficiaries: Those beneficiaries who are not included in the first-tier beneficiaries are included in second-tier beneficiaries.
Therefore, option C is correct.","Estate Planning: The planning and distribution of the tasks, income (or losses) and property to its legal heirs after the death of an individual is known as estate planning."
5,Indicate whether the statement is true or false. ,TRUE,FALSE,,,B,"The answer is ""false"", not nearly all business owners think that their heirs will need to sell part or all of the business to satisfy estate taxes. Business owners that do not own estates do not often need to worry about this, nor do business owners with enough extra capital to spend on estate taxes if they do become an issue in the future.","Estate Tax: Estate taxes are applied on an individual's property when they pass away and the property is given to heirs of the individual, usually to a loved one or another family member."
6,Which of the following is NOT correct pertaining to state QTIP planning?,It requires all property passing under a decedent's estate to be treated as marital property.,It allows estate tax to be deferred until the second spouse's death.,It allows an executor to make a QTIP election for state purposes only.,It is applicable to the extent the state and federal estate tax exemptions differ.,A,"The correct answer is a.
The marital property means the property acquired during the marriage. The QTIP planning does not require that property in this trust should be treated as marital property, as this trust can include the property acquired by the grantor during the previous marriage. This trust is used for providing income to the living spouse.
The explanation for incorrect answers:
Option b is incorrect as this trust allows for marital deductions and the taxes levied after the second spouse's death.
Option c is incorrect as the executor can make QTIP elections related to the estate only.
Option d is incorrect as the QTIP planning allows the grantor to make an exemption trust between the state tax and federal tax exemption amount.",QTIP: QTIP is an acronym for qualified terminal interest property trust. An individual uses this trust to give assets to the surviving spouse and define how the assets will be distributed upon the spouse's death. This trust provides income to the spouse.
7,The gift tax is imposed on the fair market value of items transferred upon death.,TRUE,FALSE,,,B,"The above statement is false.
Reason: The above statement is false because gift tax is implied on the value of the property transferred by one person to another as gift and the items transferred upon death is subjected to tax under inheritance tax.",Inheritance tax: Inheritance tax is a tax paid by the person who gets the property of a deceased person as inherited property. Inheritance tax is different from estate tax because it is charged on the property received by the estate beneficiary.

9,Identify which of the following statements is false?,The lifetime exemption applies only to gifts given.,Casualty or theft losses incurred during the administration of the estate are deductible on the estate tax return.,"The estate tax return is due, ignoring extensions, 9 months after the decedent's date of death.",,A,"Let us discuss each alternative:
A. The lifetime exemption applies only to gifts given.
This is the correct option because the statement is FALSE. The lifetime exemption applies to gifts given, but also to estate tax. This means that if a taxpayer has used $500,000 of their lifetime exemption, its estate tax exemption decreases by $500,000.
B. Casualty or theft losses incurred during the administration of the estate are deductible on the estate tax return.
This statement is true. Estates can generally deduct the same expenses and qualify for the same deductions as an individual taxpayer.
C. The estate tax return is due, ignoring extensions, 9 months after the decedent's date of death.
This statement is also true. The executor of an estate worth more than $11.7 million is required to file a Form 706 within 9 months of the decedent's date of death.",Deceased Estates: Deceased estates are subject to federal income tax for the period the estate is being administrated. Deceased estates are also subject to estate tax if the assets of the estate exceed the annual exclusion amount.
10,Which of the following statements is true concerning jointly owned property under Section 2040?,"When joint owners are spouses, only half of the property is included in the gross estate.","When joint owners are spouses, no portion of the property is included in the gross estate.","If a decedent held property as a joint tenant with rights of survivorship, no portion of the property is included in the gross estate.","If a decedent held property as a joint tenant with rights of survivorship, only half of the property is included in the gross estate.",A,"The correct option is
a. When joint owners are spouses, only half of the property is included in the gross estate.
For federal estate tax purposes, the value of jointly owned property is included in the deceased person's gross estate under Section 2040. The treatment varies depending on the type of joint ownership (e.g., with a spouse or non-spouse) and the percentage of the decedent's contribution to the purchase of the property.
(a)
When joint owners are spouses, only half of the property is included in the gross estate.
Only half of the value of property owned jointly by spouses as a qualified joint interest is included in the gross estate of the first spouse to pass away.
As long as they were married and held the property as joint tenants with rights of survivorship or tenants by the entirety, this law still applies even if one spouse paid the entire amount to purchase it.
This method complies with IRS regulations regarding spousal joint ownership and streamlines the inheritance tax computation for married couples.
(b)
When joint owners are spouses, no portion of the property is included in the gross estate
.
The gross estate of the first deceased spouse includes at least half of the property's value.
Even if surviving spouses make use of the unlimited marital deduction, which postpones estate taxes until the second spouse's death, the IRS still demands inclusion to guarantee correct value for estate tax purposes.
Since 50% ownership must be reflected in the gross estate, saying ""no portion"" is incorrect.
(c)
If a decedent held property as a joint tenant with rights of survivorship, no portion of the property is included in the gross estate
.
A share of the property is included in the gross estate based on the decedent's contribution to the acquisition of the property when they hold it as a joint tenant with rights of survivorship (non-spousal ownership).
For instance, 70% of the value of the jointly owned property would be included in the decedent's gross estate if they had paid 70% of the purchase price.
The IRS regulations that attribute inclusion based on contributions for non-spousal joint ownership are disregarded when ""no portion"" is stated.
(d)
If a decedent held property as a joint tenant with rights of survivorship, only half of the property is included in the gross estate
.
This statement is only true for spousal joint ownership, where 50% of the property is included regardless of contribution.
For non-spousal joint tenants with rights of survivorship, inclusion is determined by the percentage of the decedent's financial contribution to the property.
For instance, if two non-spouses co-own property and one contributed 80% of the funds, then 80% of the property would be included in that person's gross estate upon their death.
Conclusion
:
From the above discussions, it can be concluded that option (a) is the correct answer because it accurately describes the IRS rules for spousal joint ownership under Section 2040.
Other options misrepresent the inclusion rules for spousal or non-spousal joint ownership and are therefore incorrect.","Jointly Owned Property: According to IRS regulations, property held by two or more people, such as joint tenants or tenants by the entirety, is referred to as jointly owned property. The kind of ownership and contribution to the purchase of the property determines the value included in the decedent's gross estate for estate tax purposes."
11,"Jose created a joint bank account for himself and his friend, Amparo.",When the account is created.,When Jose notifies Amparo that the account has been created.,When Amparo withdraws money from the account for her benefit.,When Jose dies.,C,"The correct answer is option
c. When Amparo withdraws money from the account for her benefit.
Gifts must have three main requirements. Firstly, there should be intention from the donor to transfer the property. Secondly, the donor should deliver the gift to the donee. Finally, the donee must accept the gift. In case of a joint account, the gift is not made until the donee withdraws money from the account for her benefit (this represents the acceptance).","Gift: In legal sense, the concept of Gift can be defined as the voluntary or intentional transfer of property from a donor to a donee. One of the main characteristics of a gift is that it should be given without any compensation in return."

13,A(n) _____ gives the surviving owner or heir of a family business the right to purchase the stock of the deceased owner at a price established by a predetermined formula.,grantor-retained annuity trust,estate freeze,unified transfer credit,buy/sell agreement,D,"Correct option:
D) buy/sell agreement
Incorrect option:
A) grantor-retained annuity trust
B) estate freeze
C) unified transfer credit
Explanation:
Grantor-retained annuity trust is the type of plan in which assets are kept under a trust to receive the annuity by the grantor.
Estate freeze is a plan to exchange preference share with the common stock of a company to avoid capital gain taxes.
Unified transfer credit is the amount of assets which are allowed to be gifted to other persons without paying for the taxes.
Buy/sell agreement is the agreement to decide the future sharing/purchasing of the business shares in case of the death of owner.
From above these we can say that, buy/sell agreement is the correct term",Tax planning Tax planning is a way to decide the tax expenses and benefits arising out of the assets and investments by an organization/individual. Tax-deductible expenses and exceptions helps to save the amounts for the respective owner.

15,The failure of an individual to have a will can result in which of the following?,I only,II only,Both I and II,Neither I nor II,C,"The correct choice is option c. Both I and II.
When a person declares legally that he or she intends to get his or her assets distributed in a certain way or wishes something to happen in a certain way after his or her death, it is known as a ""will."" It can be canceled or changed only when the person is alive.
A will specifies the people who can get a share of their inheritance.
I. Favorite relatives who are supposed to be included in the will by the testator cannot get an inheritance as they are not legally bound to receive an inheritance in the case of no will.
II. A testamentary gift is a gift given by a person to charity after his or her death. In the case of no will, these gifts cannot become effective.
Therefore, both statements I and II are true.","Estate planning (EP) An EP is the procedure in which the assets of a person are managed and distributed after the occurrence of death or incapacitation of the person. The assets should be preserved before they are distributed. As part of planning, the EP has certain tasks to perform, such as making a will as per the preferences of the person."
16,"Regarding estate planning, all the following statements concerning ""net gifts"" are correct EXCEPT:","If the gift tax paid by the donee exceeds the donor's cost basis, the donor is in receipt of taxable income.",Only the net amount of the gift will be considered as an adjusted taxable gift in the estate tax computation.,The gift tax paid by the donee can be credited against the donor's estate taxes.,The unified tax credit is not available for net gifts,D,"The correct answer is
D. The unified tax credit is not available for net gifts
Under estate planning, the policy owner may have specific wishes for the beneficiaries who can be liable to receive proceeds of investments on assets or sure tax gifts. For example, net grants require the done to receive the net amount of the issued gift while remitting the taxes for the gift as an individual. Thus, the gift recipient takes on the tax liability that comes with the present. In net gift guidelines, the gift issue can have taxes remitted by beneficiaries credited in the estate taxes. Additionally, when computing estate tax, the original amount of the gift is the basis of reference. However, these types of estate planning have no combined credit on tax because tax credits can reduce or omit tax obligations required by the federal government.",Estate Planning: It is a type of planning that helps in managing individual assets for unforeseen events such as death or incapacitation. The objective of estate planning is to ensure that all the beneficiaries of the assets bestowed upon the asset manager get to receive their proceeds when the policyholder is incapacitated or dies. Examples of assets used in estate planning include real estate or companies with increasing value due to plant or machinery operations.
17,In a grantor-retained annuity trust:,"there is an attempt to minimize taxes on a family by creating two classes of stock preferred stock, whose value is locked in, and common stock, whose value reflects the market value of the business.","a business owner can pass on up to $10,000 annually, which is exempt from federal gift taxes.",the grantor retains the voting power and interest income from the stock in the trust for up to ten years.,the surviving owner or heir of a family business has the right to purchase the stock of the deceased owner at a price established by a predetermined formula.,C,"Correct option: C
Reason: Grantor is the person who creates trust to transfer the assets for tax-saving and then get annuity payments every year out of it. This scheme is known as grantor-retained annuity trust.
Explanation for incorrect options:
A.	Tax-saving by using the preference stock and common stock is done under estate freeze plan.
B.	Federal gift taxation allowed an exemption of upto $10000 annually.
D.	Purchase stock of deceased owner by the surviving owner is a feature of buy/sell agreement.
So, we can say C is the correct explanation for the grantor-retained annuity trust","Tax-planning Tax planning is a process to plan for asset purchases or transferring of gifts, wealth, etc. in such a manner that it minimizes the tax payments. This helps in generating tax benefits from the tax-efficient plans to the organization/individual"
18,The fair market value of the interest retained by the grantor of a GRAT is subject to the gift tax.,TRUE,FALSE,,,B,"The provided statement is False.
GRAT, an acronym for grantor retained annuity trust, is defined as a financial tool, especially used in the real estate industry. Under this, the trust is created, and the value of the gifted item would be transferred to this trust to freeze this value. It is done to reduce taxes on gifted items. Therefore, the grantor requires to pay tax only when a trust is created. Hence, there is no need to make tax payments on gain received from the gift moved to trust.","Gift Tax: Gift tax is explained as a federal tax on a valuable gift like property, money, etc., which one individual gives to someone else. Under this, the gift donor requires to record this gift on his/her tax return and make a tax payment."
19,A tax that is imposed on the right to pass property at death is classified as an estate tax.,TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The above statement is true.
A tax on ability to transmit property after death is the estate tax. It consists of a list of everything owned or had a stake in as of the date of passing. These products are valued at their fair market worth, not necessarily the price paid for them or the value they had when bought them. 'Gross Estate"" is the sum of all of these possessions. The assets that are included in the calculation of the included property can include money and securities, property, insurance, trusts, annuities, business interests, and other assets.","Inheritance tax When people receive money or property from a deceased person's estate, they are required to pay an inheritance tax, which is a type of state tax. Instead of the estate, as is the case with the federal estate tax, the tax is paid by the property's heir."

22,The basis of property received by gift is zero.,TRUE,FALSE,,,B,"The given statement is
false
.
Under the IRS, the property basis that an individual or party receives as a gift depends upon 3 different amounts:
What is the adjusted basis of the donor before transferring the property as a gift?
At the time of the donor giving the gift, what is the actual market value of the property provided?
Whether there was any gift tax on such gifts was paid or not.
Therefore, from the above explanation, it is evident that the property basis provided by the donor as a gift can't be zero as it is interlinked with 3 different amounts as per the specified situations. So, the statement is
false
.",Gift Tax The gift tax applies under the federal government to the valuable financial items that are given by one individual as a gift to another person. The donor is the payee of such a tax and not the recipient of the gift.
23,Which of the following statements concerning federal gift and estate taxes is (are) correct?,I only,II only,Both I and II,Neither I nor II,C,"Answer choice
c)  Both I and II
Explanation:
The IRS has made a rule regarding gifts made within three years of death.  If an individual gifts property within 3 years of their death then it must be included in the value of the gross estate.  Gifts are subject to federal income tax.  There is a gift tax exclusion for the first $15,000.  Any gift tax paid on gifts that were made within three years of death are included in the gross estate.",Gift and Estate Taxes: An estate is defined as the net worth of a person at some point in time which includes their assets less their liabilities at that point in time.  Many individuals will gift assets to family members before their death but these are also subject to federal income tax.

25,A decedent owed 300 shares of closely-held XYZ stock jointly with her brother. This property must be reported on :,Form 706 Sche E,Form 706 Sche F,Form 706 Sche J,,B,"Form 706, Schedule E, is used to report if the decedent held property of any kind jointly at his or her death. Hence, option B is correct.
Form 706 Schedule E:
Suppose an individual is required to submit Form 706. In that case, Schedule E must be filled out and submitted with the return regardless of whether the decedent's share is permissible in the gross estate. This is true if the deceased owned any joint assets at the moment of death.
In this schedule, any properties that the deceased had at the time of death, whether it be private property, rental properties, banking information, an interest as a tenant by the entirety, or as a part owner with the right of survivorship, should also be filled.
Explanation of other options
Form 706 Schedule F:
An individual uses Form 706 Schedule F if the deceased person had ever filed a lawsuit at the time of their passing, or the estate has engaged in or is thinking about filing a lawsuit over the decedent's passing and will include.
Form 706 Schedule J:
Under this Form, the deduction is only allowed for the cost of these expenditures that are permitted by local law but are not necessarily exceed:
The value of the assets included in the net estate is subject to claims, plus the sum from assets that were part of the gross property but weren't claimed. Before the estate tax return's due date, it must pay this sum in full. The appropriate local law under which the estate is being administered determines which property is subject to claims and which is not.","Estate Tax: In the USA, the estate tax is a federal tax levied on a decedent's estate distribution. If a person dies without leaving a will, state intestacy laws will apply to the transfer of property."

28,"{eq}\rule{1cm}{0.15mm}

{/eq} refers to coping with financial realities of estate and gift taxes.",Stage 2,Stage 3,Stage 4,Stage 5,D,"The correct option is D) Stage 5
Explanation:
The gift tax is an assessment that people should pay when they move a gift to another person. The IRS characterizes a blessing as an exchange of property starting with one individual then onto the next, where the supplier doesn't get installment for the full market esteem. The gift could be cash, yet it could likewise be different resources, like stock or land. By and large, you don't need to stress over paying any duties on the gift you get from friends and family. It's the provider of a gift, not the collector, that would document a gift assessment form and possibly settle the gift tax. The fifth step, in general, refers to dealing with the financial reality of estate and gift taxes.","Gift: A gift or a present is a thing offered to somebody without the assumption for installment or anything as a trade-off. A thing isn't a gift if that thing is as of now claimed by the one to whom it is given. Even though gift-giving may include an assumption for correspondence, a gift is intended to be free."
29,All the following statements concerning the generation-skipping transfer tax rules are correct EXCEPT:,No generation-skipping transfer tax (GSTT) is levied unless either the life-income beneficiary or the remainderman are two or more generations younger than the grantor.,"The purpose of the GSTT is to exact a tax essentially equivalent to the estate tax that would have been levied if the property had been passed outright to the beneficiary, rather than just a life interest.","When a grantor's child dies after possessing a life interest, the estate of the next generation beneficiary is liable for the GSTT.","Upon the death of the grantor, the GSTT rules still apply where the trust bypasses the grantor's living son or daughter and names the son's or daughter's child as the beneficiary.",D,"The correct answer is
D. Upon the grantor's death; the GSTT rules will still apply where the trust bypasses the grantor's living son or daughter and names the son's or daughter's child as the beneficiary.
Estate planning adopts the generation-skipping tax-transfer, which depicts a tax by the federal government on situations of transferring gifts or property to the named beneficiaries, usually younger than the gift issuer. It thus prevents the asset owner from purposefully assuming the offspring of their children in the estate plans with favoritism meant to reduce tax obligations on the assets when they die. Under this policy, the transfer of taxes on the gifts only occurs if the grantor and their children are two generations older than their beneficiaries. It, therefore, avoids a life interest on the contributions, for when the grantor perishes, the named beneficiaries should be awarded the generational tax skipping transfer. From the explanations above, we can conclude that choice is incorrect because it does not explain the GSTT rules of estate planning.","Trusts: A trust describes a lawful plan where an individual's assets and estates can be controlled and managed by another firm or individual. The trustee, in this case, has the role of making sure that the assets and the estates are issued out to the beneficiaries as stated by the owner. A trust can ensure that the policy owner's assets have privacy, protection, and lower gift or estate taxes. In estate planning, trusts are developed to foresee the grantor's will while they are alive and distribute the assets or estates to the beneficiaries while the owner is still alive."

Hazel does not contribute any money to the account.","Ellen deposits $100,000 cash and Dennis deposits $5,000 cash into a joint savings account. Dennis withdraws $20,000.","Ellen gives her church $15,000.",Ellen pays the hospital medical bills for her friend Paige directly to the hospital.,B,"The correct answer is option B.
Dennis has withdrawn $20,000 from the joint account, while her contribution in the joint account was $5,000. Now this means she has withdrawn $15,000 in excess of her contribution, and according to to the limits of taxable gifts exclusion, any withdrawal made by the account holder (which is less as compared to other holders)  of more than $14,000 contribution will be treated as taxable gifts in the hands of the other account holder.
Incorrect options:
a.In this case, money has been transferred by Ellen, However,  Hazel has withdrawn nothing; therefore, $60,000 cannot be considered a taxable gift.
c. The amount given to the church is a donation to a qualified charitable organization that will not come under taxable gifts.
d.There is no exclusion limit in case of medical expenses paid for another person if the expenses are directly paid to the hospital,Therefore this will not come under taxable gifts.",Annual Exclusion An annual exclusion is just the sum of money that can be given as a gift to anyone without triggering the gift tax or altering the consolidated credit.

Since the estate selected a September year end, the first tax year of the estate will be 10/23/16 to 9/30/17. Estimated tax payments for an estate are not required to be made for a tax year that ends prior to two years after the date of death. Dave died on 10/23/2016.
