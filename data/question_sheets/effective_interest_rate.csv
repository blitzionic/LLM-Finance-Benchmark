1,A loan that compounds interest monthly has an EAR of 14.40 percent. What is the APR?,13.53 percent,13.59 percent,13.96 percent,14.07 percent,A,"Given information:
EAR = 14.40%
Number of compounding periods (n) = 12
Note:
The number of compounding periods is 12 as the loan is compounding monthly, resulting in 12 months of compound interest.
The annual percentage rate (APR) can be calculated using the information of the equivalent annual rate (APR) and the number of compounding periods in the following way:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm{APR}} &= \left[ {\left( {{{\left( {1 + {\rm{EAR}}} \right)}^{\frac{1}{{\rm{n}}}}}} \right) - 1} \right] \times {\rm{n}}\\ &= \left[ {\left( {{{\left( {1 + 14.40\% } \right)}^{\frac{1}{{12}}}}} \right) - 1} \right] \times 12\\ &= \left( {1.01127 - 1} \right) \times 12\\ &= 0.1353\end{align*} {/eq}
Therefore, the APR of the loan is 0.1353 or 13.53%.
Hence, the correct answer is option a.",Annual Percentage Rate: The annual percentage rate showcases the yearly rate at which an individual will receive interest in case of loan is given or needs to pay it if a loan is taken. It can be used for mortgages or loans.
2,Which of the following loan terms would result in the lowest annual cost?,"4%, compounded daily.","4%, compounded monthly.","4%, compounded quarterly.","4%, compounded annually.",D,"The answer is
d. 4%, compounded annually.
If a loan is offered with the compounding interest, a borrower should determine the effective annual interest rate on the loan, in which it reflects the true financing cost to the borrower.
The more frequent interest is compounded, the higher the effective financing cost will be on a loan. Hence, the lowest annual cost should be associated with the annual compounding interest.",Effective Annual Interest Rate: The effective annual interest rate will be always higher than the annual percentage rate since it reflects the additional interest earnings on interest. That explains why investors will be more attracted to investments offered with the compounding interest.
3,What is the effective annual rate for an APR of 15.90 percent compounded monthly?,16.03%,17.11%,16.99%,16.87%,B,"The effective annual rate is 17.11% (B).

10,Another name for the effective interest rate is the market interest rate.,TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The given statement is
true.
The effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate of interest or usage that is payable by a borrower on the amount borrowed. It is calculated after considering the effect of compounding, its frequency, additional fees, and the actual repayment and interest paid. In common terminology, the EIR is also known as the market rate or yield to maturity. The other rate is the nominal rate, or quoted rate, for the loan. This is the rate of interest that is usually stated explicitly in the borrowing agreements. However, when other factors are taken into account, the nominal rate and EIR differ. The investor can compare the EIR or market rate with the quoted rate to make informed decisions.
For example, suppose the borrower is quoted a 10% p.a. rate but the interest is compounded twice a year. The EIR will be 10.25%.
Suppose:
Number of periods: 2
Nominal rate: 10%
EIR is calculated as follows:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{EIR} &={{\left( 1+\frac{\text{Nominal Rate}}{\text{Number of periods}} \right)}^{\text{Number of periods}}}-1 \\ &={{\left( 1+\frac{10\%}{2} \right)}^{2}}-1 \\ &=10.25\% \end{aligned} {/eq}",Interest: Interest is the additional amount that is payable or receivable on a sum of money.

b. The 15% option accumulates more over a year; it has an EAR of 15.5% as opposed to the 14% option which has an EAR of 15.0%.
Determine the effective annual interest rate of each investment:

30,"An amortized, 3-year loan has annual payments and an effective annual rate of 14.56 percent. What is the APR?",13.09 percent,13.46 percent,13.90 percent,14.56 percent,C,"The correct answer is
option c.13.90%
APR and EAR are two different measures of interest rates that are frequently used in finance.
APR is levied on credit loans or loans that include both interest rates and fees. Whereas, EAR is the actual annual rate of interest paid or received on the investment.
Given information:
EAR = 14.56%
No of years = 3
Calculate the annual percentage rate from EAR.
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{APR} &=n\times \left( {{\left( \text{EAR+1} \right)}^{\frac{1}{n}}}-1 \right) \\ &=3\times \left( {{\left( 0.1456+1 \right)}^{\frac{1}{3}}}-1 \right) \\ &=3\times \left( {{\left( 1.1456 \right)}^{\frac{1}{3}}}-1 \right) \\ &=3\times \left( 1.046304-1 \right) \\ &=3\times .046304 \\ &=.1389\text{ or 13}\text{.90 }\!\!\%\!\!\text{ } \\ \end{aligned} {/eq}

d. 13.88%
.
When it is said that interest is compounded continuously, that means the interest on the principal is compounded and added back to the account balance for an infinite number of periods. However, it's not common in the investment sector. Most of the securities provide interest compounded annually, semiannually, quarterly or monthly.
When the nominal interest rate is compounded continuously, its effective annual rate can be calculated using the following formula:
{eq}EAR = e^i-1 {/eq}
Where,
i = the stated or nominal interest rate compounded continuously = 13%.
e = a mathematical constant having an approximate value of 2.7183.
Therefore, the effective annual rate of 13% compounded continuously is calculated as follows:
{eq}\begin{align*} EAR &= e^i-1\\ &=e^{0.13}-1\\ &=0.138828383\\ &=13.88\%\\ \end{align*} {/eq}The Answer is D.","Meaning of the Effective Annual Rate: Every investment security or loan carries a stated rate of interest which is called the nominal rate. The effective annual rate estimates the actual interest earned on an investment or paid on a loan after taking into account the effect of compounding the nominal rate over a specified period.

Where,
{eq}r {/eq} is the nominal interest rate or the annual percentage rate expressed in decimal form.
{eq}n {/eq} is the number of times interest is compounded per year.
The EAR for each given option can be calculated using this formula and compared to determine the highest among them.
A) Bank CD that pays 7.10 percent compounded monthly
:
Here,
{eq}r=7.10\%=0.0710 \\ n=12; \text{ since there are 12 months in a year} {/eq}
So,

B) Bank CD that pays 7.25 percent compounded semiannually
:
Here,
{eq}r=7.25\%=0.0725 \\ n=2; \text{ semiannually means that it is compounded every half year} {/eq}
So,

C) Bank CD that pays 7.30 percent annually
:
Here,
{eq}r=7.30\%=0.0730 \\ n=1 {/eq}
Hence,
{eq}\begin{align*} EAR_C&=\left(1+\dfrac{0.0730}{1} \right)^1-1 \\ &=\left(1+0.0730 \right)^1-1 \\ &=1.0730-1 \\ &=0.0730 \\ &=7.30\% \end{align*} {/eq}
D) Bank CD that pays 7.00 percent interest compounded daily
:
{eq}r=7.00\%=0.0700 \\ n=365; \text{ since there are 365 days in a year} {/eq}

The effective annual interest rate is the actual rate of return that an investor can earn from their investment after taking into account the effect of compounding per period. Similarly, it is the rate at which the interest owed by a borrower on a loan or any debt is calculated.
Returns from different financial products can be compared by comparing their respective effective annual rates with different compounding frequencies, like annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, or continuously.
Thus, the EAR increases if the compounding frequency increases for the same nominal interest rate, the highest being if the interest is compounded continuously and the lowest if it is compounded annually.","Annual Percentage Rate: The annual percentage rate, or APR, is the simple interest rate per annum applicable on a loan, mortgage, credit card, etc. It also refers to the yearly interest rate earned on an investment.
