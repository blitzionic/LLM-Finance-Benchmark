Correct. The discounted payback period ignores cash flows after the payback, in which there might be large cash inflows after the payback.
b. Incorrect. The discounted payback period uses the project's cash flows.
c. Incorrect. The time value of money is included in the discounted payback period, in which each cash flow is measured in today's dollars.","Discounted Payback Period: The discounted payback period is a common budgeting method that describes the length of time to recover a project's initial investment. The discounted payback period includes the effects of the time value of money in its calculation, which is more relevant than the regular payback period."

However, this method has some limitations in that it may not consider the time value of money. To overcome this limitation, a technique known as discounted payback period was developed."
4,Compute the payback period for a project with the following cash flows received uniformly within each year:,2.17 years.,3 years.,4 years.,3.17 years.,A,"The correct answer is option
a. 2.17 years
.
The total cash flows for the first 2 years are computed as:
= Cash flow for Year 1 + Cash flow for Year 2

The time period in which the balance amount of $10 (i.e. initial cost of $100 - $90) can be paid back is given by:
= Balance amount / Cash flow for Year 3
{eq}= \dfrac{\$10}{\$60}

= 2.17 years",Payback Analysis: The payback period represents the time horizon over which the investment in a project can be recouped. The shortcoming of the technique is that it does not take into account the time value of money or discount rate.
5,True or False: A disadvantage of the payback method is that it does not consider which investment is the most profitable.,True,False,,,A,"The provided statement is
true
.
The payback period only accounts for the length of time required to recover the initial outlay of investment.
It doesn't consider the time value of money. It also does not consider what happens to cash inflows after the payback period is over. Thus, it disregards the overall profitability of an investment.","Capital Budgeting: Capital budgeting is an approach that identifies whether long-term projects or purchases of fixed assets must be initiated or not.

Statement
True/False
An advantage of the break-even time (BET) method over the payback period method is that it recognizes the time value of money.
The statement is false because both the break-even point and payback period don't use the time value of money. The payback period is a capital budgeting technique that determines the time investment needs to recover its cost. The break-even point determines the sales level at which a company makes no profits or losses.",Time Value of Money: The time value of money concept provides that money has potential earning capacity due to which its value in the future is far more than its current value. Most capital budgeting techniques use the concept to determine an investment's efficiency and profitability.

False.
Statement
True/False
When computing payback period, the year in which a capital investment is made is year 1.
The statement is false because the initial investment is made in the year 0, using which the project generates cash flows annually. This is why the present value of investment cost is always the same as the cost itself. The present value factor at any discount rate for year 0 is 1.",Payback Period: A capital budgeting technique that determines how long an investment takes to recover its initial cost is known as the payback period. It can be computed using two formulas depending on the nature of annual cash flows.

B. indeterminate, i.e., it will never pay back.
The net present value represents an actual cash value added to a project.
The discounted payback period measures the length of time to recover the project's cash outlays with the consideration of the time value of money.
A negative net present value indicates that the sum of present value of all cash flows is less than the initial costs. In this case, the discounted payback period cannot be determined.",Net Present Value (NPV): Net present value (NPV) is a capital budgeting technique to estimate the difference between the project's present value and its cash outlays.

10,The Silverside Company is considering investing in two alternative projects:,3.85 years.,15.63 years.,8.55 years.,4.67 years.,A,"The correct option is
A. 3.85 years.

Initial Investment = $500,000
Annual net cash inflows = $130,000
We know that -
{eq}\text{Cash payback period} = \dfrac{\text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Annual net cash inflows}} {/eq}
Putting values, we get -
{eq}\begin{align} \text{Cash payback period} &= \dfrac{\text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Annual net cash inflows}}\\ &= \dfrac{\$500,000}{\$130,000}\\ &= \text{3.85 years} \end{align} {/eq}",Cash Payback Period: The cash payback period is useful for those industries which require quick recovery of the investments made.

11,Neither the payback period nor the accounting rate of return methods of evaluating investments considers the time value of money.,True,False,,,A,"The given statement is
true
.
The payback period calculates the time needed to recover your investment. This computation totals the cash flows from each year and determines how long it will take to recover the invested money.
Because of this, money's time value is not considered when calculating the cash flows for each year.

So, the accounting rate of return takes accounting profit and ignores the time value of money in calculations.",Payback period: The payback period is the duration needed to recover the investment made in a property or assets from its net cash flows. It is easy to assess the risk involved with a project proposal.
12,Which of the following statements concerning payback analysis is true?,The payback method ignores the time value of money concept.,The payback method and the unadjusted rate of return are different approaches that will consistently lead to the same conclusion.,All of these are true.,An investment with a longer payback is preferable to an investment with a shorter payback.,A,"The correct answer is Option A.
The payback period ignores the time value of money and is measured in terms of the years it takes to repay the money invested. It is based on the cash flow concept and does not cover discounting strategy. There are two possible calculations after finding the cumulative cashflows:
1.	When there is an even cash flow, the payback period is the division of initial investment into annual cash flow.
2.	When there is an unequal cash flow, payback time is the summation of years that came before the year of recovery and dividing the amount left to be recovered and cash flow during the final year.
The project is certain if there is a shorter payback period. Therefore, money's risk and time value are disregarded when calculating the payback period.",Payback Period: The payback period is the duration spent to recover an investor's original investment. It helps the firms look for comparable investment avenues to help them choose the better option.

Option C. the project's payback period will be unchanged
.
The payback period ignores the cash flows generated after recovering the investment cost. A project's payback period is determined to be four years in the given case. The additional cash flows generated in years five and six have no impact on the payback period, as the investment cost is already recovered in four years.
Based on the above explanation, the first two options are eliminated, and the last option is incorrect as the payback period ignores the time value of money, and using a discount rate is out of the question.",Capital Budgeting: Capital budgeting refers to evaluating capital investments and analyzing them according to their ability to create profits.

Explanation:
In the PBP (payback period) method, the viability of a potential investment in a venture would be scrutinized on the basis of the length of time the venture would take to retrieve the initial cost assigned to the project or venture.
Without any consideration of the TVM (time value of money) concept, a venture would be classified as feasible if its payback period is shorter than the maximum payback accepted by the entity, and if some ventures are competing, the most attractive venture would be the one of them with the shortest PBP.
As a result, statement ""a"" is true that if all other variables are the same, an investment with a smaller payback period is preferable to an investment with a longer payback period. And also, the statement ""b"" is true that the payback method ignores the TVM concept.Hence, alternative ""d"" would be verified as the correct answer, and all other alternatives are not suitable.","Capital Investment Analysis Tools Enterprises have to invest their resources in the ventures that have been examined as feasible in financial terms.

This approach is generally used in all capital budgeting formulas, as the underlying assumption is that initial investment is made now, and the first benefits will be received one year from now (In Year 1, therefore).",Payback Period: The payback period is the number of years it is estimated to take to recover the cash invested in a new project. The payback period technique is used in capital budgeting to evaluate and compare proposed investments.
17,"When a capital investment is expected to provide unequal annual cash inflows, the payback period cannot be calculated.",True,False,,,B,"The statement is FALSE.
When a capital project is expected to provide unequal annual cash inflows, we cannot use the payable formula that divides the initial cash outflow through the expected annual cash inflows. We then rather use the cumulative cash flows from the project, and the year in which the cumulative cash flows exceed the initial cost, we use the average cash flow per month to find the exact answer.",Payback Period: The payback period technique is a popular technique used in capital budgeting to evaluate proposed investments. It is intuitive and it uses information that is readily available but has the drawback that it does not consider the time value of money.

36,What is a significant disadvantage of the payback period?,Does not properly consider the time value of money.,Is complicated to explain.,Increase firm risk.,Provides a measure if liquidity.,A,"The correct answer is
a. Does not properly consider the time value of money.
The payback period's disregard for the time value of money is its most serious disadvantage. According to the principle of the time value of money, cash flows generated early on in a project are more valuable than those acquired in later years. This is because early cash flows have a more significant earning potential; they can be reinvested to earn profits, thus creating larger amounts of money in the future. The payback period technique does not clearly indicate which project should be chosen when two projects have the same payback duration but one earns more revenue in its early years and the other has better cash flows in its later years. Therefore the correct answer is option a), and the other options are incorrect.","Payback Period: In capital budgeting, the length of time required to recover an investment's cost is known as the payback period. It determines which project should be selected based on the time it will take to recover all initial expenses. Compared to projects with longer payback periods, those with shorter payback periods are more attractive."
37,Which of the following statements indicates a disadvantage of using the discounted payback period for capital budgeting decisions?,The discounted payback period does not take the project's entire life into account.,The discounted payback period does not take the time value of money into an account.,The discounted payback period is calculated using net income instead of cash flows.,,A,"A. Correct. The discounted payback period ignores all cash flows after the payback. This is a disadvantage of the method since there might be large cash inflows after the cutoff point.
B. Incorrect. Apart from the regular payback period, the discounted payback period considers the effects of the time value of money, which explains why a discounted payback period is usually longer than the regular payback period.
C. Incorrect. Both the regular payback period and the discounted payback period are practiced on the project's cash flows.","Discounted Payback Period: The discounted payback period determines the length of time that a firm can regain all costs invested in a project.

d. payback period
is the exact amount of time it takes the firm to recover its initial investment in a project.
The following table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons.
a. net present value
The net present value is the present value of future cash flows minus the initial cash outflow of a project.
b. internal rate of return
The internal rate of return is the discount percentage where the present value of all future cash flows equals the initial investment cost.
c. average rate of return
The average rate of return expresses the accounting profit from an investment as a percentage of the average capital invested.
d. payback period
This is the correct alternative because the payback period represents the number of years it will take to recover the initial cash outflow. It is calculated by dividing the initial investment by the expected annual cash flow.","Capital Budgeting Techniques: In capital budgeting, proposed capital projects are evaluated.

Options
Analysis
a. payback.
The payback period considers the annual cash flows and the investment cost to determine the number of years necessary to repay the original investment cost, ignoring the time value of money.
b. discount factor.
Discount factor is used when the time value of money is considered, which is not the case in the payback period computation.
c. accounting rate of return.
Accounting rate of return ignores the time value of money and uses net income and average capital employed to calculate the return.
d. time value of money.

(B.) Amount invested
is the correct answer.
The time it would take to recoup the value of an investment is often referred to as the payback period. The payback period is determined by dividing the initial investment by all of the yearly cash flow. The payback period is used by account and investment managers to assess whether or not to proceed with an investment.
A. Expected annual cash inflow
is incorrect because the expected cash flows are ignored here. Only actual cash inflows are used, and they are in the denominator.
C. Net cash outflow
is incorrect because it is not taken into account while calculating the payback period.
D. Total cash inflows
is incorrect because it is a part of the denominator; the amount invested is the numerator.","Payback Period: The payback period is the amount of time required to repay the invested amount or to achieve break-even for an investor.

to say that a disadvantage of the payback period is that it ignores the time value of money.
The payback period is a simple capital budgeting technique that determines the time in which an investment will recover its initial investment. The method involves the calculation of the period at which the investment reaches the break-even point and starts generating profits after that. A project with a shorter payback is preferable because the investment will recover sooner. The payback method is used because of its simplicity and ease of use. However, there are many disadvantages to using the payback period method to evaluate capital projects. One of the main disadvantages is that it does not consider the time value of money when evaluating the cash flows. In the simple payback period method, there is no discounting of cash flows. It can lead to inaccurate decisions when choosing a project. The other disadvantages are that it does not account for cash flows beyond the payback period and ignores risk and profitability.",Capital Budgeting: Capital budgeting is a process that is used to make informed investment decisions that impact the long-term profitability and value of an enterprise.

46,The payback period rule accepts all projects for which the payback period is:,Greater than the cut-off value.,Less than the cut-off value.,Positive.,An integer.,B,"Answer:
B. Less than the cut-off value.
When analyzing an independent project, the payback criterion dictates that one should accept a project whose payback period is less than the set cut-off. For example, let us say that the cut-off of a project is four years; however, you compute the payback period to be three years; therefore, you should accept such a project. However, if the payback period is more than the cut-off, say six years, in our case, you should decline such a project.
Incorrect answers:
A. Greater than the cut-off value
is incorrect since this will be the basis of rejecting the project.
C. Positive.
is incorrect since the number of years will always be positive.
D. An integer
