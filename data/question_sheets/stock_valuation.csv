2,Accounting and reporting for equity securities where the company has 20 - 50% ownership use which of the following methods?,Equity.,Consolidation.,Fair value.,Amortized cost.,A,"The correct answer is A, i.e., equity
Explanation:
(A) Equity method:
When one firm, the investor, significantly influences another company, the investee, the equity method is employed. A corporation is said to have substantial influence when it owns between 20 and 50 percent of the equity of another company.
Companies that own less than 20% of another company's stock could have considerable influence on the company. If they do, then, they must also apply the equity approach.
The explanation for incorrect options:
(B) Consolidation method:
The subsidiary and the parent business balances are reported in a single statement. Thus, the term ""consolidated"" is under the consolidation technique. When using the consolidation approach, a parent business adds all of the revenue from a subsidiary to its own.
(C) Fair value method:
The fair value accounting method is followed when assessing the company's liability in its present market. In other words, ""fair value"" is the price at which one might sell an asset while still being fair to the seller and the buyer.
(D) Amortized cost:
A fixed asset's amortized cost is the portion of its cost charged to expenses through depreciation or amortization. Intangible fixed assets are notably reduced through amortization, and tangible fixed assets are notably reduced through depreciation",Equity method: The equity method is an accounting method used when investing in another company. It is used when the investor controls 20 to 50% of voting stock and gets the right to vote on any decision in investing company.

4,An investor should purchase a stock when:,the market price is greater than the justified price.,the capital gains rate is less than the required return and no dividends are paid.,the market price exceeds the intrinsic value.,the expected rate of return equals or exceeds the required return.,D,"Option D
is the correct answer.
When the expected rate of return is higher than the required one, the investor will make a profit. If the rate is the same, he will make neither a profit nor a loss. Hence, option D is right.
Option A: When the market price is higher than the justified price, the security is overvalued and should be avoided for investment purposes. Hence, option A is wrong.
Option B: When the capital gain rate is lower than the required rate of return, the investor will end up incurring a loss. Hence, option B is wrong.
Option C: When the market price exceeds the intrinsic value, the security is overvalued and should not be purchased. Hence, option C is wrong.",Stocks: Stocks are one of the most return-enhancing investments. One can earn an inflation-beating return with stocks and at the same time earn current income.

8,Which one of the following is a requirement of the two-stage dividend growth model?,both growth rates must be less than the discount rate,one of the two growth rates must exceed the discount rate,the first growth rate must exceed the second growth rate,the second growth rate must be less than the discount rate,E,"Correct Answer: E
The discount rate must be higher than the second growth rate in the two-stage growth model. The denominator term in the stock valuation model requires reducing the second growth from the discount rate. If the growth rate is high, the stock value will turn negative. A zero growth rate will yield an infinite value. So the second growth rate must be less.
An explanation for incorrect options:
Option A: First growth rate is not necessary to be higher than the discount rate. The reason is that difference between the first growth rate and the discount rate is not applicable in the formula.
Option B: Second should not exceed; there is no choice anyone can exceed.
Option C: There is no restriction in the relationship between the two growth rates.",Second Growth Rate: The growth rate applicable after the initial growth rate in the two or multi-stage growth model is known as the second growth rate. The second growth rate will also serve as the final growth rate in the two-stage model.

Options
Analysis
a. The board of directors of the firm.
The board, elected by the common stockholders, determines the dividend per share, not the market price.
b. The stock exchange on which the stock is listed.

34,What would you pay for a stock which just paid a $5 dividend (D0) if the expected dividend and earnings growth rate is 4% and you require a 16% return on your investment?,$33,$43,$51,$77,B,"The correct answer is
Option b) $43
.
The dividend growth model is made of the following components:
Expected dividend (Refer to the Step 1) = $5.20
Constant growth rate = 4%
Required return = 16%
In the first step, we will determine the expected dividend, which represents the dividend receivable in the coming year.
{eq}\text{Expected dividend} = \text{Current dividend × (1 + Constant growth rate)} = \$5 × (1 + 0.04) = \$5.20 {/eq}
Upon arranging the components listed above in a logical manner, the following outcome is derived:
{eq}\text{Stock's current price} = \dfrac{\text{Expected dividend}}{\text{Required return - Constant growth rate}} = \dfrac{\$5.20}{16\% - 4\%} = \$43.33 {/eq}
Option b) $43 is the closest value of the stock's current price.

Interest rates are the most important element in determining the value of a stock. Increasing interest rates reduce a company's profit margins by increasing the cost of borrowing money. Stock prices are anticipated to fall as a result of reduced profitability. An interest rate decrease, which lowers the cost of borrowing money, is frequently beneficial when the economy is ailing and stock values are falling. However, this is not always the case. Stocks took a hit after the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decrease was deemed insufficient.","Stock Prices: Everyone interested in stock market transactions needs to know the factors influencing the share price.

The correct answer is option C), i.e., $50.63.
Given information:
Dividend (Div0) paid = $3.75
Growth rate (g) = 8%
Market rate of return (r) = 16%
Calculating the common stock price:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm{Stock}}\,{\rm{Price}} &= \frac{{{\rm{Di}}{{\rm{v}}_1}}}{{{\rm{r}} - {\rm{g}}}}\\ &= \frac{{\$ 4.05}}{{16\% - 8\% }}\\ &= \frac{{\$ 4.05}}{{0.08}}\\ &= \$ 50.63\end{align*} {/eq}
