1,The income tax base for an individual tax return is:,Adjusted gross income.,Gross income.,Adjusted gross income minus AGI deductions.,Realized income from whatever source derived.,C,"The correct option is
c. Adjusted gross income minus AGI deductions.
The income tax base for an individual tax return is calculated based on the adjusted gross income (AGI) minus AGI deductions. Adjusted gross income is the amount left over after tax-deductible expenses and other deductions have been subtracted from gross income. Interest on loans, money put away for retirement, and self-employment taxes are all eligible for this category of deductions. The income tax base, which is determined by subtracting an individual's AGI deductions, is the sum that is used to compute their income tax liability.
Explanation for other options:
a. Adjusted gross income: Income tax bases are determined in large part by deductions, which are ignored by calculating adjusted gross income alone.
b. Gross income: Income tax bases are incorrectly estimated when using gross income because it does not take into account any adjustments or deductions.
d. Realized income from whatever source derived: The phrase ""realized income from whatever source derived"" is too general and does not include all of the necessary deductions and adjustments for computing an individual's taxable income.","Tax Structure: The government needs the money to run the country.

Taxes on firms' external costs are meant to force the organizational decision-makers to consider the total cost of their actions. The external costs of taxes push the organizations to use all the resources appropriately without polluting the environment to avoid heavier tax imposition. The external price is the environment surrounding the firm. Imposing taxes on the environmental costs aids in ensuring that the firms take full responsibility.
Options a, b and d are incorrect. External costs are the surrounding firm's external environment. Although the government makes revenue through taxes, imposing taxes on the external costs of a significant firm aim to create responsibilities and protect the environment, thus making the firm decision-makers consider their actions on the external environment. Taxes discourage more production as increased taxes discourage increased production. External tariffs are not meant to push businesses out of the industry but instead make them consider external environment protection.","Taxes: Taxes are a significant source of government revenue.

b) False
.
The value of sales is $600, and it is subject to a 5% sales tax. The total amount to be collected from the customer is the sales value, including sales tax.
Debit to Accounts Receivable = Sales × (1 + Sales tax rate)

However, the seller collects it from the customer and pays it to the respective government.","Sales Tax: In the United States, sales tax is imposed on the purchase of goods. However, it's important to note that sales tax is not levied at the federal level; instead, it is the responsibility of individual states and, in some cases, local governments."

7,A vacation home is rented out for 10 days during the year and used personally by the owner for 20 days during the year. What percentage of real estate taxes should be deducted on Schedule A?,0%,33%,67%,100%,C,"The correct answer is option
C) 67%.
Take note that if the owner used personally the house for 30 days or one month, then the total percentage of real estate taxes that will be deducted in the Schedule A is exactly 100%. However, in this problem, the owner had used the said vacation house for only 20 days. So, what we will do is to proportionately record the percentage of real estate taxes to be recorded in Schedule A.
Percentage of Real Estate Taxes = (20 / 30) x 100
Percentage of Real Estate Taxes = 0.667 x 100
Percentage of Real Estate Taxes = 66.70% or 67%
Thus, the correct answer is option C).","Real Estate Tax: In tax accounting, the real estate tax is an example of property tax that is ad valorem in nature. An ad valorem tax is based on the fair market value of the property which is levied to the owner of the latter."

10,Which of the following items is most commonly used to check the status of a court case?,Revenue ruling,Tax digest,Determination letter,Citator,D,"The correct option is
d: Citator.
Most people use a citator to find out where their case stands in the legal system. A citator is a legal research tool that details a case's preceding and subsequent proceedings. Users can observe the various interpretations and applications of a case by following its citations and references. Using a citator, one can find out if a case is still binding precedent, if it has been overturned or changed, and what effect it has had on subsequent decisions.
Explanation for other options:
a. Revenue ruling: Revenue rulings are the IRS's official interpretations of tax law and have nothing to do with judicial proceedings.
b. Tax digest: A tax digest is not relevant to the status of a case in court; it is merely a compilation of tax laws and regulations from a given jurisdiction.
c. Determination letter: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will issue a written document called a determination letter if a taxpayer requests a ruling on their tax status or a specific tax matter.

option D.
The debt that the buyer assumes, as well as the commissions and legal fees paid by the seller in conjunction with the sale, must be considered in competing the seller's amount realized from the exchange of property.",Exchange under Section 1031 of Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Codecovers exchange a real estate transaction wherein the taxpayer sells real property held for use in a trade or as an investment and uses the proceeds from the sale to acquire the replacement property.
12,The most important tax for determining an individual's incentive to work is,the marginal tax rate.,the average tax rate.,the last tax rate.,the total tax rate.,A,"The correct answer is option a. Marginal tax rate is the total amount of the additional tax paid to any additional income earned in the form of a dollar. The marginal tax rate accounts for any additional dollar that an individual makes. This can be an incentive as additional income.
Option b, c, and d are incorrect. The average tax rate represents the total tax paid divided by the individual taxable income. The last tax rate is the final tax that an individual or a business pays following the total reduction needed in their operations. The total tax rate is the total yearly tax that a business or an individual owes. Total tax is laid in brackets depending on the economic terms as economies differ in countries.","Taxes: In any country, collecting taxes is a fundamental way of generating public revenues for use by the government.

13,Which financial statement shows the amount for Freight-In (transportation costs associated with the delivery of goods)?,income statement,statement of owner's equity,balance sheet,trial balance,A,"Correct Option:
A
.
Explanation for the correct answer:
Freight-in is the expense related to the basic operations for carrying out the business or trading activities. Hence it must be debited in the income statement only.
Explanation for the incorrect answers:
Option: B.
It is wrong as the statement of owner's equity includes the items regarding equities and stocks.
Option: C.
It is wrong as the balance sheet does not include expenses; it has liabilities and assets only.
Option: D.
It is wrong as the trial balances just include the closing balance of ledger accounts and not the expense incurred.","Freight: This is the expense that has to be paid when the goods from one place are transferred to another place. Freight has to be paid for making goods delivered to the concerned receiver, and thus, this is the expense related to the operating activities of the business."
14,The government tax collection and spending is concerned with monetary policy tools.,Trueb. False,,,,C,"The government tax collection and spending is concerned with monetary policy tools.
The above-given statement is
FALSE.
A government's tax collection and spending activities are associated with fiscal rather than monetary policy. The monetary policy is associated with the nation's money supply and other factors. Carried out by the economy's central bank, monetary policy involves actions such as interest rate adjustments, buying and selling securities, etc. Whereas a government has the authority to collect tax for generating revenue and spending on public goods, such responsibilities come under the implementation of fiscal policy for stimulating the population's aggregate demand.
Therefore, tax collection and government spending are associated with fiscal policy instead of monetary policy because monetary policy is concerned with money supply.",Tax Collection: Tax collection is a government activity that generates income for economic expenditure. The government collects money from direct income earners and indirectly through the sale of products and services subject to taxation.
15,"As a paid tax preparer, you are automatically authorized to represent your client before the IRS.",True,False,,,B,"b. False.
Even if you get paid to do taxes, that doesn't mean you have the right to represent your client in front of the IRS. Only enrolled agents, CPAs, and attorneys are allowed to represent taxpayers before the IRS. These experts have proven their proficiency by passing difficult examinations or fulfilling other significant requirements.
The IRS's Annual Filing Season Program (AFSP) Record of Completion is a certification available to tax preparers who are not enrolled agents, certified public accountants, or attorneys. This means that non-credentialed tax preparers can represent clients whose returns they prepared and signed, but only in front of specific IRS employees like customer service reps.
Therefore, you cannot represent clients before the IRS just because you are a paid tax preparer.","Internal Revenue Services: To collect taxes from citizens and businesses and to enforce the country's tax code, the government funds the Internal Revenue Service.

When any tax is levied on the producers or customers, then that tax is generally paid by the customers only either directly or indirectly. It is because the producers have to take all measures such as costs, profit margins, tax, and so on from the customers. The tax attained from the customers does not provide any subsidy to the producers. The tax does not have anything in common with the price floor and price ceiling.",Taxes Taxes could be recognized as the collection of monetary funds due to the occurrence of any action or an event.

18,The following taxes are regressive except:,FICA and self-employment taxes,federal income tax for individuals,All of these.,unemployment taxes,B,"The correct option is
B. federal income tax for individuals
The individual federal income tax is not a regressive tax but rather a progressive tax. Tax rates in a progressive system rise in tandem with a person's or business's taxable income. Therefore, the tax burden is heavier for those with higher incomes compared to those with lower incomes. The system here takes into account each individual's financial situation.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
A. FICA and self-employment taxes
Because FICA and self-employment taxes are generally viewed as regressive, option A is incorrect. They are imposed at a flat rate up to a certain income level, so those with lower incomes pay a larger share of their income in this way than those with higher incomes.
C. All of these.
Since option A and D is not correct, this can not be correct.
D. unemployment taxes
Since unemployment taxes are often levied at a flat rate and have a wage base limit, which means that those with higher incomes pay a smaller percentage of their income in these taxes, option D is incorrect.","Progressive Tax: Progressive tax refers to the tax strategy of the Internal Revenue Service, where the tax rate increases as income rises. Higher-earning individuals pay higher tax, and lower-income people pay lower tax."
19,"What feature of the federal income tax system is known as a ""shadow tax""?",the earned income tax credit,the payroll tax,the flat individual income tax,the alternative minimum tax,D,"The answer is D).
The alternative minimum tax (AMT) is the tax rate assessed on certain individuals with high income. This tax is not coded in the federal income tax schedule and is, therefore, referred to as a shadow tax. Individuals subjected to AMT must file Form 6251 with the Internal Revenue Service.
Earned income tax credit reduces tax liability hence, it is not a tax.
Payroll tax is explicit and flat: 6% for social security and 1.5% for medicare. Hence, it is not a ""shadow"" tax.","Progressive Tax: A tax schedule is progressive if the marginal tax rate increases with the taxable amount. In this case, the average tax rate is always lower than the marginal tax rate."

.
External auditors are the officials or experts in the field of accounting. External auditors should be an outsider to the organization. Auditors investigate and assess the financial records of the organization. The assessment is to avoid errors and frauds in the books of accounts. An external audit takes place once a year at the end of the calendar year. They are also called independent auditors. The independent auditors follow a different set of standards from that of the company's they audit, and hence it is essential to know the external trends.",Taxation: A tax is a charge imposed by the government on any person or any firm.

22,Tim Bridges owns a bass fishing boat. His state imposes an annual 3.25 percent tax on the current value of this boat. What type of tax is this most likely to be?,General sales tax,Excise tax,Personal property tax,Income tax,C,"The correct answer is
Option c.
The annual tax of 3.25% imposed by the government on the current value of the fishing boat purchased by Tim Bridges is the personal property tax. It helps the government earn revenue by charging taxes on personal property owned by an individual.
Other Options:
Option a is incorrect since general sales tax is not related to private assets. It is imposed on goods sold.
Option b is incorrect since excise duty is not levied on the current value of any personal estate.
Option d is incorrect since income tax is related to income, not any tangible asset.
Option e is incorrect because the estate tax is calculated on a person's estate when he had died.","Direct Tax When a person or an entity pays a tax to the government without any intermediary, it is known as direct tax. No one else pays tax on behalf of such a taxpayer. Income tax is an example of direct tax that is a major source of revenue for the government."
23,Where is the power to issue income tax granted to the federal government?,The 16th Amendment to the Constitution,The Bill of Rights,The 20th Amendment to the Constitution,The Declaration of Independence,A,"The correct answer is
option A: The 16th Amendment to the Constitution.
The Federal Government derives its power to issue income tax from the
16th Amendment to the United States Constitution
.
The 16th amendment, which was passed in 1909, gives Congress the liberty to collect taxes. Through the amendment, the federal government was able to create a nationwide income tax policy. Without a doubt, income tax has grown into the single largest source of income for the federal government.

24,Government imposes taxes to:,uplift weaker sections,check the accumulation of wealth among the rich,run the machinery of the state,None of these.,C,"Government imposes taxes to:
C. run the machinery of the state
.
The government needs funds to finance the programs and schemes that it introduces. Financing these activities by loans creates an unnecessary burden on the authority and the citizens. Taxes generate revenue for the public authorities, which does not create a burden on the government or the citizens as much as loans would. Taxes are used to run various programs and fund the government's activities.

25,"Assume that you had a bad year in the stock market with capital gains of $10,000 and capital losses of $25,000. How much can you write off on this year's tax return?","$10,000","$13,000","$15,000","$25,000",B,"The answer is
b. $13,000.
Given information:
Capital gains = $10,000
Capital losses = $25,000
Since the capital losses exceed the capital gains in the year, there will be a net capital loss. In this case, the capital gains will be written off 100%. In addition, an amount of $3,000 from the net capital loss is eligible to be deducted from taxable income. The remaining net capital loss will be carried forward to the next year.
Net capital loss = Capital losses - Capital gains = $25,000 - $10,000 = $15,000
Write-off for capital gain = $10,000
Write-off for net capital loss = lesser of $3,000 or remaining capital loss ($15,000) = $3,000
Total write-off amount = Write-off for capital gains + Additional write-off for net capital loss
Total write-off amount = $10,000 + $3,000

26,The value-added tax is a type of consumption tax.,True,False,,,A,"The correct answer is
option A. True
.
Value-added tax (VAT) can be explained as the type of indirect tax that applies to an increase in value at each stage of the supply chain, which includes the production, distribution, and sale of goods or services. VAT is a type of consumption tax because the ultimate consumer of the goods indirectly pays the taxes; the price of the goods includes the taxes that are borne by the consumer when they buy the goods. It is one of the major sources of revenue for the government, as the tax proceeds that the businesses collect from consumers are ultimately paid to them.","Tax: Tax is a compulsory financial obligation towards the government, and it is levied on businesses, entities, and individuals. It can be referred to as the contribution of citizens and organizations to the government for funding various country projects."
27,Income taxes can be accurately said to:,affect the decision to work and save.,have no effect on the decision to work and save.,result in more dependence on support from the federal government.,have a positive effect on the decision to work but a negative effect on the decision to save.,A,"The correct option is a. affect the decision to work and save.
Income taxes have a direct impact on a person's net labor income and savings returns, which in turn affects their choice to work more (or less) and save more (or less). If people believe they aren't keeping enough of their earned income, higher income tax rates may deter them from working more hours. Similar to the above, high tax rates on savings returns may deter saving. In essence, income taxes have the power to change the ratio of current consumption to future consumption.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
b. have no effect on the decision to work and save:
Income taxes do have an impact on whether or not people choose to work and save money, so option b is untrue.
c. result in more dependence on support from the federal government:
This choice is incorrect because income taxes do not directly lead to increased reliance on federal assistance. Government services are funded by taxes, but this does not always result in greater dependency.
d. have a positive effect on the decision to work but a negative effect on the decision to save:
Income taxes have the potential to discourage not only saving but also working and earning money. The precise outcome depends on how high the tax rates are and how people respond to them.","Tax Structure: The tax system refers to the government's initiative to collect revenue from individuals and corporations.

29,Total inefficiency caused by a tax is the sum of _____ and _____.,administrative costs; deadweight loss,producer surplus; government revenue,producer deficit; consumer surplus,opportunity costs; consumer deficit,A,"The correct option is
A. administrative costs; deadweight loss
.
Taxes diminish a society's efficiency by incurring high administrative costs, resulting in deadweight losses. Firstly, tax imposes a burden on the government that charges it due to the high expense of collection and administration. Collecting taxes from all income earners is extremely difficult and expensive. After collection, the tax amount had to be maintained and evaluated, and other operations had a large administrative expense. Thus, the tax causes inefficiencies in the economy by raising unproductive government expenses.
Second, taxes lower both manufacturing and consumer surpluses. The extra amount a seller gains when the market price of his goods exceeds the minimal amount he is prepared to accept for that item is referred to as producer surplus. Consumer surplus, on the other hand, represents the extra amount obtained by a buyer when the market price of the acquired item is less than what the buyer is prepared to spend for that item. When the government levies a tax on a certain item, the market price of that item rises. The consumer surplus decreased as the tax reduced the gap between the consumer's anticipated costs and the actual cost of the goods.
Producers, on the other hand, although receiving larger revenues from sales than previously, must pay a considerable sum to the government in the form of tax. As a result, producer surplus falls as the difference between the producer's minimum acceptable price and the actual price shrinks. As a result of the tax, the equilibrium quantity transacted also decreases. However, only the government benefits from increased tax collection. Finally, the amount of surplus loss incurred by both the buyer and the seller not absorbed by the government and reduces the transaction output is referred to as deadweight loss. It demonstrates the inefficiencies of taxes by illustrating how taxation harms consumers and producers.
Thus, Total inefficiency caused by a tax is the sum of
administrative cost
and
deadweight loss
.
The other options are incorrect:
B. producer surplus; government revenue. The inefficiency associated with taxes is attributable to the expense borne by society, which makes all economic actors worse. Producer surplus and government income benefit both producers and the government. As a result, tax inefficiency is unrelated to producer surplus and state revenue.
C. producer deficit; consumer surplus. A consumer surplus is a monetary gain on a purchase made by the customer. Tax cannot benefit consumers since it boosts the price charged to buyers. As a result, consumer surplus cannot demonstrate inefficiency in taxes. However, a producer deficit indicates inefficient taxation.
D. opportunity costs; consumer deficit. Although tax increases the price of a commodity and leads to consumer deficit, opportunity cost does not represent tax inefficiency since it occurs in every economic activity in the form of the forgone gain of conducting an alternative activity without the need for tax imposition.","Tax: Taxes are the annual, necessary contributions made by a nation's citizens to its government.

a.
The option is not true as taxes lowers the amount that is saved. Therefore, taxes affect the level of savings and investment in the economy.
b.
The option is true as income tax is defined as the tax which is levied on the income of the citizens. Therefore, as the tax rate rises, the disposable income of the citizens would decrease and therefore, the savings and investment would decrease.

In regressive taxes, the government collects a higher level of taxes from the low-income earners and a comparatively lower level of taxes from the high-income earners. Thus, the people belonging to the lower-income strata have to pay a higher proportion of taxes from their income compared to those belonging to the higher-income strata.
Reasons for incorrect options:
Option b. is incorrect because the tax, which places a higher burden on the wealthy taxpayers compared to people who earn less, is a progressive tax.
Option c. is incorrect because when regressive taxes are imposed, the poor taxpayers are not exempted from taxes, and they have to pay higher taxes than the rich taxpayers.
Option d. is incorrect because tax rates can rise over time even when regressive taxes are imposed.",Taxes: A mandatory payment that the individuals in an economy are obliged to make to the government to finance the administrative activities in the country is referred to as a tax.

32,The excess profits tax was first imposed:,during World War I.,during the Civil War.,during the War of 1812.,during the Spanish-American War.,A,"The correct option is
a. during World War I.
During World War I, the first tax on excessive profits was levied. It was implemented as a stopgap measure to raise funds for the war effort by taxing companies' inflated wartime profits. The purpose of the tax was to prevent businesses from engaging in price gouging and profiteering during the national emergency by ensuring that they pay their fair share towards the war financing.
b. during the Civil War:
Since the excess profits tax was not in place during the Civil War. The Union government collected income and excise taxes, among others, to fund the war effort during the Civil War.
c. during the War of 1812:
Because the excess profits tax was not in place during the War of 1812. Customs duties and other indirect taxes were the primary sources of revenue for the federal government at that time.

d. all of the above.
Everything that goes into paying workers is included in payroll and related expenses. Wages and salaries are examples of direct compensation for labor. Fringe benefits, such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off, are extra perks that an employee receives in addition to their base salary. Employers in the United States must withhold and remit Social Security and Medicare from their employees' paychecks. Payroll and related costs encompass not only salaries and wages but also fringe benefits and payroll taxes.","Payroll Tax: The payroll can be paid by both the employees and the employers, where some deductions are made from the paychecks of the employees, and employers also pay some portion, and the accumulated amount from the economy is used to fund the employee's welfare schemes."
34,Tax and spend is,a classical economics concept in nature,a Keynesian concept in nature,primarily an emphasis on free enterprise economy,a little used area of monetary policy,B,"The correct option is
b. a Keynesian concept in nature
The term ""tax and spend"" describes a strategy where the federal government uses its tax and spending powers to control economic aggregate demand. This strategy is commonly associated with Keynesian economics, which promotes the role of government in moderating business cycles and keeping the economy at full employment.
Here are the reasons why other options are not true:
These are the fallacies of alternative explanations:
a. a classical economics concept in nature:
A concept with roots in classical economics, which emphasizes slow and steady growth over short-term stimulus measures. Keynesian economics, which prioritizes short-term stability, is more congruent with tax and spending policies.
c. primarily an emphasis on free enterprise economy:
A primary focus on the free-market economy, which places less emphasis on centralized planning and more on the initiative of private citizens.
d. a little used area of monetary policy:
Government fiscal policy, not central bank monetary policy, is responsible for tax and spending policies.","Tax: The tax rate refers to the revenue of the government, which is collected from the economy and used for the various purposes of the government.

The journal entry for this transaction looks like this:
{eq}\begin{array}{ c | l | r | r }

{/eq}
The cash collected from the customer is $4,000 and 4% sales tax of $320 ($4,000 × 4%).  This makes cash flow from the operating activities amount to $4,320.  The revenue is the sales price of $4,000, which also increases the equity.  The sales tax collected from the customer is recognized as a liability.  Note that the sales tax collected from the customer is not a company expense and does not decrease the $4,000 revenue.  Thus, (a) is the correct answer.","Sales Taxes Sales taxes are taxes imposed on goods and or services of a seller.  These taxes are allowed by law to be passed on to the customer, who, in turn, pays the sales taxes.

39,Which one of the following payroll taxes is not withheld from the employee's wages because it is not levied on the employee?,Federal income tax,Federal unemployment tax,State income tax,FICA tax,B,"The correct option is
b. Federal unemployment tax
Since employees are not required by law to pay FUTA, no such tax is deducted from their pay. Employers foot the bill for the entire FUTA tax, which goes toward supporting individual states' unemployment insurance programs. Participants in these programs receive benefits while deserving employees are unemployed. This is a tax that is covered by the company and not felt by the worker, as it is paid by the business on their behalf.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
a. Federal income tax:
The employee's taxable income determines the amount of federal income tax that will be withheld from their paycheck. The employee can expect the correct amount to be withheld from each paycheck by the company.
c. State income tax:
Depending on the employee's taxable income, state income tax may also be withheld from their paychecks, so this choice is incorrect.
d. FICA tax:

b. Sales taxes and use taxes.
Both the sales tax and the use tax are examples of regressive taxation. Taxes that are regressive are those that place a disproportionate financial burden on those with lower incomes. Since people with lower incomes tend to spend a larger share of their income on taxable goods, sales taxes, which are levied on the purchase of these items, are often considered regressive. Taxes on the use or consumption of a product are often viewed as regressive for the same reasons.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
a. Income taxes based on ability to pay:
This is incorrect because income taxes based on ability to pay, also known as progressive income taxes, are structured to impose a higher tax rate on people with higher incomes.
c. Additional sales and use taxes imposed on luxury vehicles:
This option is incorrect because the additional sales and use taxes imposed on luxury vehicles are not indicative of general sales and use taxes; rather, they are aimed at luxury goods.

45,The tax benefit received from a tax credit is never affected by the tax rate of the taxpayer.,True,False,,,A,"The statement is
true
.
The tax benefit received from a tax credit is never affected by the tax rate of the taxpayer because a tax credit is deducted from the tax on the taxable amount, which is used for calculating the net tax payable.
Let us look at the income tax formula to illustrate this:
All income received
Minus:
Income specifically excluded
Equals:
Gross income
Minus:
Adjustments to income (For-AGI deductions)
Equals
Adjusted gross income (AGI)
Minus:
Standard deduction or itemized deductions (From-AGI deductions)
Personal and dependency exemptions
Equals:
Taxable income
Multiplied by
Taxpayer's tax rate
Equals:
Tax on taxable amount
Minus:
Tax Credit
Equal
Tax payable (refundable)
We can see from the calculation above that tax credits are deducted after the tax rates have been applied to calculate the tax on the taxable income. This means that a $1,000 tax credit will bring the same amount of tax relief for a taxpayer with a tax rate of 15% and a taxpayer with a tax rate of 40%.
This is different for tax deductions. Tax deductions decrease the taxable income. The tax rate affects the dollar amount in tax savings for a taxpayer.","Income Tax Formula: The income tax formula is a step-by-step description of how the income tax payable is calculated.
