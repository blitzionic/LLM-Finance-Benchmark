1,"A trial balance has total debits of $20,000 and total credits of $24,500. Which one of the following errors would create this imbalance?","A $2,250 credit to Consulting Fees Earned in a journal entry is incorrectly posted to the ledger as a $2,250 debit, leaving the Consulting Fees Earned account with a $6,300 credit balance.b. A $4,500 debit to Salaries Expense in a journal entry is incorrectly posted to the ledger as a $4,500 credit, leaving the Salaries Expense account with a $750 debit balance.c. A $2,250 debit to Rent Expense in a journal entry is incorrectly posted to the ledger as a $2,250 credit, leaving the Rent Expense account with a $3,000 debit balance.d. A $2,250 debit posting to Accounts Receivable was posted mistakenly to Cash.e. A $4,500 debit posting to Equipment was posted mistakenly to Supplies.",,,,C,"The correct option is
(c.) A $2,250 debit to Rent Expense in a journal entry is incorrectly posted to the ledger as a $2,250 credit.
The balance of the Rent Expense should have been $3,000 + $2,250 for the missing debit entry and + $2,250 to remove the incorrect credit entry = $7,500. If the correct balance ($7,500) is recorded on the trial balance is recorded on the trial balance instead of the incorrect balance of $3,000, the total debits will change to $24,500 and the trial balance will balance.
The other answers are incorrect:
a. A $2,250 credit to Consulting Fees Earned in a journal entry is incorrectly posted to the ledger as a $2,250 debit, leaving the Consulting Fees Earned account with a $6,300 credit balance.
The error caused the balance to decrease by double the amount of the entry because a credit entry was missing and an incorrect debit entry decreased the account balance. The correct balance for Consulting Fees Earned is $6,300 + $2,250 + $2,250 = $10,800. Correcting the mistake would increase the total credits to $29,000, and the trial balance would still not balance.
b. A $4,500 debit to Salaries Expense in a journal entry is incorrectly posted to the ledger as a $4,500 credit, leaving the Salaries Expense account with a $750 debit balance.
The correct amount for Salaries is $750 + $4,500 + $4,500 = $9,750. If this is corrected on the trial balance, the total debits would be $29,000 so the trial balance would still not balance.
d. A $2,250 debit posting to Accounts Receivable was posted mistakenly to Cash.
The trial balance will balance as long as all debit postings were posted for the correct amount to the debit side. In this case, the Accounts Receivable and Cash account balance will be wrong, but the trial balance will be in balance.
e. A $4,500 debit posting to Equipment was posted mistakenly to Supplies.
The trial balance will balance because equal debits and credits were posted. The balances of the Equipment and Supplies accounts would be wrong because of the posting error.
f. An entry debiting Cash and crediting Notes Payable for $4,500 was mistakenly not posted.
This trial balance will balance because both the debit and credit entries were omitted. The balances of the Cash and Notes Payable accounts would, however, be wrong.",Trial Balance: A trial balance is prepared for internal use only. It is prepared at various stages of the accounting cycle to summarize the general ledger account balances and to reveal errors made in transaction processing.
2,"Under IFRS, the unrealized loss on trading investments should be reported:","as part of other comprehensive loss, reducing net income.","on the income statement, reducing net income.","as part of other comprehensive loss, not affecting net income.","directly to stockholders' equity, bypassing the income statement.",B,"Under IFRS, the unrealized loss on trading investments should be reported b. on the income statement, reducing net income.
The following table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons.
a. as part of other comprehensive loss, reducing net income.
Other comprehensive gains and losses do not affect net income.
b. on the income statement, reducing net income.
This is the correct alternative because unrealized gains and losses on trading investments are not part of other comprehensive income. Instead, they are reported in the non-operating section of the balance sheet, separately from realized gains and losses.
c. as part of other comprehensive loss, not affecting net income.
This is true for available-for-sale investments, not trading investments.
d. directly to stockholders' equity, bypassing the income statement.
Only dividends are reported directly in stockholders' equity. Gains and losses always affect the income statement or the statement of other comprehensive income.","Trading Investments: Trading investments are investments in the stocks and bonds of other companies that the company holds to sell in the short term. Companies buy trading investments to profit from short-term market movements, not long-term capital growth."
3,Which one of the following is a source of equity?,Notes payable,Accounts payable,Land,Contributed capital,D,"The correct answer is
d. Contributed capital
.
Contributed capital consists of two components:
Stock's par value
Stock premium or discount resulting from the sale of stock at a premium or discount reflected in the ""additional paid-in capital"" account.
The contributed capital is the primary source of equity, usually raised to make long-term investments.
A brief explanation of each incorrect option is provided in the table below:
Answer Options
Explanation
a. Notes payable
It is a liability resulting from borrowing cash against a note.
b. Accounts payable
It is a liability resulting from the credit purchase of goods.
c. Land

4,All of the following are the external users of the financial statements except:,Company's Managers.,Investors.,Suppliers.,Customers.,A,"Internal users of financial statements are people who are part of the business organization and use these statements. Meanwhile, external users of financial statements are the people outside the business organization or the people who are not part of the business entity and also use these financial statements. Examples of internal users are the employees and the company's managers, while examples of external users are the investors, lenders, regulators, customers, and suppliers. Three of the given options, which are investors, suppliers, and customers, are external users. So, the only users that are not external among the options are the company's managers, who are internal users.
Thus, option a. Company's Managers is the answer.","Users of Financial Statements: Financial statements, such as the income statement and the balance sheet, are crucial in businesses as they show the financial health of a company and can help in making important business decisions. The users of these financial statements can be categorized into internal users and external users."
5,"The balance sheet of United Studios at December 31 showed assets of $30,000 and shareholders equity of $20,000. What were the liabilities at December 31?","$30,000","$10,000","$20,000",$50.000,B,"The correct answer is
b. $10,000
.
Given information:
Assets = $30,000
Shareholders' equity = $20,000
The calculation of liabilities using the accounting equation which states that the total assets equate to the sum of stockholders' equity and liabilities is as follows:

6,The term revenue can best be described as the:,cash received from selling goods and serving customers during a given accounting period.,selling price of goods and services rendered to customers during a given accounting period.,net increase in owners' equity during a given period.,bottom line in the income statement.,B,"The correct answer is
b. selling price of goods and services rendered to customers during a given accounting period.
Revenue is the top line of the income statement, It reflects the amount of goods and services rendered to customers during a given accounting period. All expenses of the given accounting period are subtracted from revenue to arrive at the net income.
Explanation for incorrect options
The cash received from selling goods and serving customers during a given accounting period is the cash collection from customers; hence option (a) is incorrect.
The net increase in owners' equity during a given period is the change in owner's equity; hence option (c) is incorrect.
The bottom line in the income statement is the net income; hence option (d) is incorrect,","Income Statement: The income statement of the financial statements along with the balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and the statement of changes in equity. The income statement shows all the revenue and expenses of the business for the given period."
7,Determine the financial statement on which retained earnings may appear.,income statement,balance sheet,both the income statement and the balance sheet,neither the income statement nor the balance sheet,B,"Retained earnings may appear on the
b. balance sheet
Retained earnings are presented on the balance sheet under the stockholders' equity section. It represents the total accumulated net income over the company's lifetime minus dividends paid to shareholders. The movements in retained earnings for the reporting period are presented in the statement of changes in stockholders' equity.
In the Income Statement, expenses are deducted from revenue to calculate the net income for the period. This net income is then carried forward to the statement of changes in stockholders' equity, specifically to the retained earnings column. Retained Earnings are not presented on the income statement.","Financial Statements: The annual financial statements companies prepare for external use indicate different aspects of the issuer's financial situation. The income statement reports the results of the company's operations, the balance sheet shows its financial position and the statement of cash flow shows its cash flows for the reporting period."
8,A common-size analysis of the balance sheet is most likely to signal investors that the company:,has increased sales.,is using assets efficiently.,is becoming more leveraged.,,C,"The correct answer is
c. is becoming more leveraged.
In the common-size analysis of the balance sheet, every line item is expressed as a percentage of total assets. Financial leverage indicates the extent to which a company uses debt to finance its assets, and this is precisely what the total liabilities line in the common-sized balance sheet will report; investors can then compare this value of the current and prior period to conclude whether the company is becoming more leveraged.
The other answer choices are incorrect.
a. has increased sales. The common-sized
income statement
, not the balance sheet, will indicate if sales revenue has increased.
b. is using assets efficiently. Efficiency ratios like return on total assets or return indicate whether the company uses its assets efficiently, not common-sized financial statements.","Common-Size Analysis: Financial statements include much information, and investors and analysts must interpret this information to draw appropriate conclusions. Common-sized analysis is used to dissect financial statements and identify trends and issues."
9,Determine the financial statement on which depreciation expense would appear.,income statement,balance sheet,both the income statement and the balance sheet,neither the income statement nor the balance sheet,A,"The depreciation expense would appear on the
a. income statement
The income statement is the financial statement in which the revenues and expenses for a period are listed, and the net income is calculated. The income statement starts with the revenue and the cost of goods sold expense is deducted to find the gross profit. Then, the operating expenses are deducted to find the net operating income. Depreciation is typically one of the operating expenses.
Option b. is incorrect because expenses are not presented on the balance sheet. The related contra-asset account called Accumulated Depreciation shows the carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment on the balance sheet.","Financial Statements: A company's financial statements are designed to give users a complete picture of the results of a company's operations, its cash flows for the reporting period, and its financial position at the end of the reporting period."
10,Which of the following is a financial statement produced by companies?,Assessment sheet,Statement of cash flows,Statement of gross Income,Expense statement,B,"The correct option is b. Statement of cash flows.
The annual financial statements of a company consist of the :
Income statement in which the revenues and expenses for the period are reported.
The balance sheet in which the assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity account balance on the reporting date are presented.
The statement of cash flow in which the cash flows are summarized in three sections.
Notes to the financial statements in which accounting policies are described and more details amount the amounts in the other statements are given.

(c.) after the income statement and the statement of owner's equity.
The balance sheet is prepared after the income statement because the net income from the income statement is carried over to the statement of owner's equity. It's prepared after the statement of owner's equity because the ending balance for owner's capital that is calculated in the statement of owner's capital is used in the balance sheet.
The other options are wrong because the balance sheet cannot be prepared before the ending owner's capital balance has been calculated in the statement of owner's equity. The ending owner's capital balance cannot be calculated before the net income has been determined in the income statement.",Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is also called the statement of financial position. It is the financial statement that presents a snapshot of the assets and liabilities of a company. Balance sheet accounts are usually carried at cost.
12,A company's profitability for a period would best be evaluated using the:,Balance sheet.,Income statement.,Cash flow statement.,,B,"The correct answer is
B. Income statement.
An income statement includes the revenues and expenses of a business for a specific timeframe. The difference between the two helps identify the profit earned or loss suffered by the business. So, an income statement helps in determining a business's profitability.
The explanation of the incorrect options is as follows:
A. A balance sheet shows a business's financial position through assets, liabilities, and owner's equity. It does not reflect the profit or loss faced. So, it cannot be used for evaluating profitability.
C. Cash flow statement: A cash flow statement shows the inflows and outflows of cash over a specific period from various activities. The difference between cash inflows and outflows will help compute the firm's liquidity, not its profitability.","Profitability: The profits earned by a business in a specific timeframe, generally a year, are called the profitability of the business. It makes it clear whether the business is operating effectively or facing losses."
13,An analysis in which all the components of an income statement are expressed as a percentage of net sales is called:,vertical analysis.,horizontal analysis.,liquidity analysis.,common-size analysis.,A,"An analysis in which all the components of an income statement are expressed as a percentage of net sales is called
a. vertical analysis
The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
a. vertical analysis.
This is the correct alternative. In vertical analysis, each line item in the financial statement is expressed as a percentage of the base amount. In the income statement, this base amount is net sales and in the balance sheet, the base amount is total assets.
b. horizontal analysis.
In horizontal analysis, the changes between the current and prior periods are expressed as percentages.
c. liquidity analysis.
Liquidity analysis is the study of a company's cash flow using ratios like the current and quick ratios.
d. common-size analysis
A common-size analysis is an analysis where the current results are compared. It includes vertical and horizontal analysis and can also include comparisons with other companies.",Income Statement: The statement prepared by qualified and skilled individuals in a business to estimate the net earnings made is called the income statement. The income statement is put together before composing the balance sheet.
14,"On the statement of cash flows prepared by the indirect method, a $50,000 gain on the sale of investments would be:",deducted from net income in converting the net income reported on the income statement to cash flows from operating activities.,added to net income in converting the net income reported on the income statement to cash flows from operating activities.,added to cash received from the sale to determine cash flows from investing activities.,deducted from cash received from the sale to determine cash flows from investing activities.,A,"The correct answer is
a. deducted from net income to convert it into cash flows from operating activities
.
When using the indirect method to calculate operating cash flows, profits from the sale of long-term investments should be subtracted from net income. This adjustment is necessary because these profits represent non-operating income and are classified as part of investing activities.
However, we cannot report them under cash flows from investing activities, but we should adjust them while determining the operating cash flows.
The profit of $50,000 will be deducted from the net income in the process of reconciling the net income to arrive at the operating cash flows.
A brief explanation of each incorrect option is provided in the table below:
Answer Options
Explanation
b. added to net income to convert it into cash flows from operations.
A gain is a non-operating income already part of the net income computation, needing a deduction.
c. added to cash received from the sale to determine cash flows from investing activities.
Investing activities only report the cash flows from asset sales, not the profits or losses.
d. deducted from cash received from the sale to determine cash flows from investing activities.
Investing activities only report the cash flows from asset sales, not the profits or losses.","Indirect Method: The indirect method is employed in creating a cash flow statement, beginning with net income, followed by incorporating adjustments for non-cash items and variations in working capital. This aids in calculating the net cash provided by operating activities."
15,Analysis of the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows will disclose:,the extent of investments in plant and equipment,net income for the period,any sales or repurchases of stock,the amount of money loaned to others,C,"Analysis of the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows will disclose
c. any sales or repurchases of stock
.
The financing activities include all transactions with creditors and shareholders. Treasury stock transactions are transactions with shareholders. The cash used to buy treasury stock is reported as a cash outflow in the statement of cash flows, while cash received from the subsequent sale of the treasury stock is reported as a cash inflow.
The other options:
Option a. the extent of investments in plant and equipment is wrong. The cash effects of investments in property, plant, and equipment are presented in the investing activities section, not the financing activities section.
b. net income for the period is wrong. Details of the net income are shown in the income statement, not the statement of cash flows.
d. the amount of money loaned to others is wrong. Details of loans made and other investments are included in the investing activities section.",Cash Flow Statement: The statement of cash flows provides useful information about a company's cash flow patterns. It gives stakeholders an insight into the economic cycle of the company and management's ability to manage its cash resources.
16,"On a multiple-step income statement, Income from Operations is computed as follows:",net sales less cost of goods soldb. cost of goods sold less total assetsc. operating expenses plus total assetsd. gross profit less total operating expenses,,,,D,"On a multiple-step income statement, Income from Operations is computed as
(d.) gross profit less total operating expenses
.
On the income statement, 'Income from Operations' is the line item right after the operating expenses (selling and administrative expenses) have been deducted from the gross profit) and before the non-operating items like interest and gains or losses on the sale of assets are deducted or added. It also excludes income tax.
The table provides reasons why the other options are incorrect:
a. net sales less cost of goods sold
This formula calculates the gross profit, not income from operations.
b. cost of goods sold less total assets
Total assets are calculated on the balance sheet and income from operations in the income statement.
c. operating expenses plus total assets
Again, total assets are not used to calculate any income statement line item",Income from Operations: The income from operations (rather than the net income) is used in several financial ratio formulas. It is therefore presented separately as a line item on the income statement when the statement is prepared in the multi-step format.

This statement is
TRUE
.
It is accurate to say that estimated liabilities involve an obligation to pay an uncertain but reasonably estimated amount owed on a known obligation. Estimated liabilities are liabilities like compensated absences, accrued warranty expenses, accrued property taxes, and pension liabilities. To be recognized as an estimated liability (instead of a known liability or a contingent liability), the liability must be:
A liability that the company knows has incurred and must pay in the future. It is not a contingent liability that might or might not be payable.
A liability that is reasonably estimatable. If the company cannot, despite its best efforts, reasonably estimate the amount of the liability, it cannot recognize the liability. It must, however, disclose full details in its financial statements.",Liabilities in Accounting: The accounting standards define a liability as a present obligation created by past events due to which an entity has to transfer resources in the future.

The adjusted trial balance is prepared after all the adjusting entries have been processed and general ledger account balances have been updated. Therefore, the balances on the adjusted trial balance are used for preparing the financial statements.
Option a. (amounts that may be out of balance) is incorrect. Any trial balance should be in balance if the entries were recorded properly in the general ledger.
Option c. (assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity only) is also incorrect. All accounts are listed on the adjusted trial balance. The post-closing trial balance only includes balance sheet accounts.
Option d. (revenues and expenses only) is also incorrect.

23,A worksheet is a substitute for a financial statement? True or false?,True,False,,,B,"This statement is
false.
A worksheet is not a substitute for a financial statement.
A financial statement is a document required by law for both public and private organizations. Financial statements must be filed with appropriate regulatory bodies. Publically traded companies must specifically file a 10-K form with the SEC annually for reporting purposes. Financial statements are required to ensure proper accounting is being performed and to prevent illegal activities.
Worksheets are internal documents used within organizations to aid in the generation of financial statements and may be used for other internal purposes. Worksheets may track the flows of capital and may be focused specifically on certain divisions or departments within the company.

Cash received from customers
We add the decrease in accounts receivable to the sales revenue to calculate the cash received from customers because the decrease indicates that the cash collections exceeded sales on account.
Sales
$513,750
Decrease in accounts receivable
$32,625
Cash received from customers
$546,375
b. Cash payments for income tax
Again, we add the decrease in tax payable to the income statement expense because cash payments for tax exceed the expense recorded.
Income tax expense
$34,500
Decrease in income tax payable
$3,900
Cash paid for income tax
$38,400
c. Explanation
The accounts receivable general ledger account is debited when the sales revenue is recorded and credited when cash collections from customers are recorded.
If the beginning and ending balance of accounts receivable differ, it implies that there is a difference between the sales revenue and the cash collected. So, the income statement sales and the cash receipts in the statement of cash flows differ.",Operating Activities: Operating activities is a section in the statement of cash flows. It refers to the sales of goods to customers and the related expenses and costs. The cash used or provided by operating activities is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows.
25,Expenses that CANNOT be traced directly to operations are identified as:,other income.,operating expenses.,cost of goods sold.,other expenses.,A,"To answer the above problem, let us discuss each of the above options.
a. Other Income: This is incorrect. Othe Income refers to generated income from non-core operations of the business. It is not considered as an expense.
b. Operating Expenses: This is incorrect. Operating Expenses relateds to a business's primary operations - the production of goods or services. They might include rent, utilities, salaries, and depreciation.
c. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): This is incorrect. It is the direct cost of producing the goods sold by a company. It includes direct materials, direct labor, and direct overhead costs.
d. Other Expenses: This is the correct answer. Other Expenses category often includes expenses that are not directly tied to a company's primary operations. Examples could include interest expense, losses from selling an asset, or extraordinary items (rare or unusual expenses).
So, the expenses that cannot be traced directly to operations are typically classified as ""other expenses."" Therefore,
the correct answer is option d. other expenses.","Financial Statements: Financial statements are essential for management to make strategic business decisions, based on the company's profitability, liquidity, solvency, and overall financial health."

c. The Adjusted Trial Balance includes the postings of the adjustments for the period in the balance of the accounts.
The adjusted trial balance is prepared after all the adjusting entries for the period have been posted, while the unadjusted trial balance is prepared after all the routine transactions have been posted but before the adjusting entries have been recorded. The difference between the two reports is the posting of the adjusting entries.
The other options are wrong:
a. The Adjusted Trial Balance will show the net income (loss) as an additional account
is wrong because net income is never a lone item on a trial balance.

d. net of tax.
Discontinued operations are reported separately from continuing operations and net of tax. It helps to avoid skewing the company's earnings results and gives a clear picture of the ongoing operations' profitability.
The other options are incorrect because:
a. as 'Other revenues and gains': This is not the correct place to report discontinued operations. These are reserved for revenue and gains that are not directly linked to the core business activities but are ongoing.
b. as 'Other expenses and losses': These are usually for expenses and losses that are not common and recurring in the normal business cycle, not for the results of discontinued operations.
c. in a separate section titled 'Irregular Item': An irregular item is a term not typically used in standard accounting practices. It is not appropriate for reporting discontinued operations.","Financial Statements: In accounting, the preparation of different financial statements is significant so that the result of business operations can be communicated thoroughly to the intended users of financial information."
28,The trial balance proves that no errors have been committed in journalizing or posting transactions.,True,False,,,B,"The statement is
b. False
.
It is incorrect to say that the trial balance proves that no errors have been committed in journalizing or posting transactions.
The trial balance lists all the general ledger account balances, with debit and credit balances in two separate columns. If the total of these two columns agrees, it proves that the total debits posted in the general ledger equals the total credits posted. It indicates that there are no mathematical errors in calculating the account balances.
However, several other errors can occur while journalizing and posting transactions, which would not affect the trial balance:
When a transaction is recorded for the wrong amount on the debit and credit side, the trial balance will remain in balance.
If a transaction is omitted or duplicated, it will not affect the trial balance.
Even if an entry is posted to the wrong general ledger account, the trial balance will still balance.
If a transaction is recorded in the wrong period, the trial balance will not identify it as an error.","Trial Balance: In the annual accounting cycle, trial balances are prepared at various times. The unadjusted trial balance is prepared after all routine processing has been completed, while the adjusted trial balance is compiled after all adjusting entries are posted. The post-closing trial balance is the final trial balance that is prepared."
29,The payment of utility expenses in cash would affect the operating activities in the statement of cash flows and the income statement but NOT the balance sheet.,True,False,,,B,"The correct answer is
b. False

Utility expenses have an impact on the cash flow statement since they are paid in cash. On the other hand, since utility expenses are included in the expense section of the income statement, they reduce total profit.
However, this has an impact on the balance sheet, since the cash also decreases, which lowers the current assets on the balance sheet.","Cash Flow Statement: A cash flow statement is a sectional representation of the cash position of an entity for a reporting period.

a. as part of other comprehensive loss, reducing net income.

b. on the income statement, reducing net income.
This is the correct alternative because unrealized gains and losses on trading investments are not part of other comprehensive income. Instead, they are reported in the non-operating section of the balance sheet, separately from realized gains and losses.
c. as part of other comprehensive loss, not affecting net income.
This is true for available-for-sale investments, not trading investments.

Note that we must identify the item that is NOT reported on the statement of cash flows.
a) The net change in stockholders' equity during the year.
This is the correct alternative. Cash flows that affect stockholders' equity are reported on the statement of cash flow but not the net change in stockholders' equity. Non-cash items like stock for bond transactions are excluded from the statement of cash flows.
b) Cash payments for plant assets during the year.
Cash payments for plant assets are included in the investing activities section as cash outflows. All cash flows related to long-term assets are presented under the investing activities section.
c) Cash receipts from sales of plant assets during the year.
Cash receipts from sales of plant assets are also included in the investing activities section as cash inflows.
d) How acquisitions of plant assets during the year were financed.
The cash outflow for the purchase of plant assets is presented in the investing activities section, while the cash inflows used for financing plant acquisitions through common stock issues are presented in the financing activities section. If plant assets were acquired in a non-cash transaction (like a bonds-for-asset exchange), the transaction is not included in the statement of cash flows.","Statement of Cash Flow: The statement of cash flow reports on the cash inflows and outflows that cause a change in the cash asset on the balance sheet during the year.

The cash payments for selling and administrative expenses that are contained in the cash payment schedules are derived from the selling and administrative expenses budget.
The other answers are incorrect:
A. Cash receipts schedule
The selling and administrative expenses budget contains information about operating expenses. Expenses do not affect cash collections.
B. Sales budget
The sales budget uses the estimated sales units and selling price per unit to calculate the budgeted sales revenue. It does not use information from the selling and administrative expenses budget.
C. Inventory purchases budget
The inventory purchases budget used the sales units and desired inventory levels to calculate the inventory that must be purchased on each budget period. It does not contain any information about selling and administrative expenses.","Preparing a Master Budget: Rather than one file, the master budget is a collection of budgets and supporting schedules.

Operating and non-operating items are not separated, and product and period costs are presented together as well. In the end, the net income is presented.
The other options are incorrect:
a. reports gross profit
is incorrect because the gross profit is presented in the multi-step format after the cost of goods sold has been deducted from sales revenue.

The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
A) prove that revenues exceed expenses if there is a net income.
The income statement reports on revenues, expenses, and net income, not the cash flows.
B) facilitate banking relationships.
Banks need the information in all financial statements to assess their clients, not just the statement of cash flow.
C) provide information about the investing and financing activities during a period.
The statement of cash flow has sections for the cash flows from investing and financing activities, But this only includes cash flows, not the total activity. The balance sheet, read together with the notes to the financial statements, is a better source of complete information about all investing and financing activities.
D) provide information about the cash receipts and cash payments during a period.

Explanation
A) Provide the account balances for preparation of the balance sheet.
The post-closing trial balance does not provide the account balances needed to prepare the balance sheet. Instead, this purpose is served by the unadjusted or adjusted trial balance.
C) Aid the journalizing and posting of the closing entries.
The post-closing trial balance is not involved in aiding the journalizing and posting of the closing entries. It is prepared after the closing entries have been journalized and posted.
D) Ensure that the ledger balances to complete the worksheet.

a. Trial Balance

The trial balance is the financial report that lists all general ledger accounts and their balances, with one column for the debit balances and the other for credit balances. The totals of these two columns must agree. If they do not, it implies a mistake (or mistakes) were made somewhere in the general ledger. Therefore, the trial balance is used as a tool to identify errors.
Note that it may not always be correct to say that
any
mistake can be detected using the trial balance because there are mistakes the trial balance may not spot. For instance, when an entry was omitted, duplicated, or processed for the incorrect amount.
Option b. is incorrect because the income statement is used to calculate the net income, not to detect errors.
Option c. is also incorrect because the balance sheet lists assets and liability account balances and will not show errors in the balances.
Option d. is incorrect because the journal is for recording transactions for the first time, not to show errors in the ledger.",Financial Reports: The financial reports are prepared for internal and external use throughout the accounting cycle.

a. Dividend history
A company's dividend history is public knowledge. It can be found on the company website and in the financial press.
b. Forecast of cash needs for the upcoming year
This is the correct alternative because the company financial statements do not include forecasts. Details for forecasted cash needs are not included in any other section of the annual report

d. All of the above are true of the statement of cash flows.
The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
a. The statement of cash flows shows where cash came from and how cash was spent.
In each of the three sections of the statement of cash flow, the cash inflows and outflows related to that activity are listed. The statement therefore presented the sources and used of cash for the period.
b. The statement of cash flows covers a span of time and is dated ""Year Ended Month Day, Year"".
The statement of cash flow covers all the cash flows for the reporting period, not just the position on the reporting date. The statement is therefore prepared for the period ended xxx, and not on xxx.
c. The statement of cash flows reports why cash increased or decreased during the period.
The sum of the net cash used or provided by the three activities listed in the statement of cash flow must equal the change in the cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. The statement of cash flow therefore explains why cash increased or decreased.

a. Retained earnings statement after net income but before dividends.
