1,Shareholders' gains come in the form of:,only dividends.,only capital gains.,dividends and capital gains.,interest payments.,C,"Correct Answer:
Option c. dividends and capital gains
.
Shareholders enjoy returns in the form of dividends and capital gains.
The dividend yield is computed as:

{/eq}
The capital gains yield is computed as:
{eq}\text{Capital gains yield } = \dfrac{\text{Ending share price - Initial share price}}{\text{Initia share price}}

46,The rightist position is that the market will reward firms for having:,a high dividend yield,a low dividend yield,"good management, regardless of dividend yield",a zero payout policy,A,"Correct answer:
Option A) a high dividend yield.
Explanation:
Firms that have a high dividend yield will be rewarded by the market in the rightist sense. The dividend yield represents the ratio of the annual dividend per share relative to the current share price. A higher dividend yield indicates that the company is not retaining much of its profits for the future and is distributing them to the shareholders. As a result of this, there will be more demand for the shares, though the company's expansion will require external financing.","Dividend Payout Ratio: A dividend payout ratio is the ratio of the annual dividends relative to the net income generated during the period.
