Explanation:
Risk premium = Expected average return - Return from Treasury bills
Risk premium = 18% - 7%
Risk premium = 11%","Risk Premium: The excess of the expected return over the risk-free return is called the risk premium. Under the capital asset pricing model, the required return is determined by adding the product of the beta coefficient and the risk premium to the risk-free return. The risk premium represents a compensation for investing in highly-risky securities."

12,"For a given set of possible cash flows, as the required risk premium for a project increases, its price must decrease to entice investors to purchase the asset.",True,False,,,A,"Correct Answer: True
When the required risk premium increases, the project's discount rate also increases. With the maximization in the discount rate, the discounted value of net cash flows decreases. So, the price must also decrease for the asset so that the positive value is generated from the project. Hence, with an increase in the risk premium, the price must decrease to generate positive value addition and entice investors to purchase the asset.","Risk Premium: The risk premium is a projects' incentive whose value increases with decreasing cash flows predictability.

18,A safe dollar is always worth less than a risky dollar because the rate of return on a safe investment is generally low and the rate of return on a risky investment is generally high.,True,False,,,B,"The answer is b. False.  When contemplating the discounting process for a safe dollar versus a risky dollar, the former will be subject to a lower discount rate than the latter.  The lower rate will have a smaller discounting effect on the safe dollar than the risky dollar.  This will result in a larger present value for the safe dollar than the risky dollar.","Risk vs. Reward: A fundamental tenet of investing is the risk/reward tradeoff.  Generally, this is a fairly strong direct relationship between risk and return.  Higher levels of one correspond with higher levels of the other.

The difference in the expected rate of return of such benchmark stock index and the risk-free rate which is usually the rate of return yielded by government securities such as T-bills is called as the market risk premium. This is the premium which investors usually demand when they invest in an average stock in the stock market.","Risk Premium: An investor usually asks for returns which are line with the risks they bear when they invest in securities in the financial markets. The premiums which they usually ask for are liquidity risk premium, default risk premium, inflation risk premium, maturity risk premium, market risk premium, foreign exchange risk premium etc."
35,The market portfolio of common stocks earned 14.7% in one year. Treasury bills earned 5.7%. What was the real risk premium on equities?,12.2%,9%,6.5%,18.7%,B,"Correct Answer:
Option B. 9%
.
The real risk premium on equities can be computed using the following equation:
Real risk premium = Market return on common stock - Return on treasury bills
Real risk premium = 14.7% - 5.7%
Real risk premium = 9%",Risk Premium: A risk premium is a concept used in the capital asset pricing model equation that helps determine the required return on the stock. The risk premium is compensation paid to the investors for investing in risky stocks.
36,"A stock has a beta of 1.2 and an expected return of 15.0 percent. If the risk-free rate is 5.3 percent, what is the market risk premium?",7.1%,6.2%,9.5%,8.1%,D,"Correct answer: Option
d) 8.1%
.
Explanation:
Expected return = Risk-free return + (Beta * Risk premium)
15% = 5.30% + (1.20 * Risk premium)
Risk premium = 8.10%",Risk Premium: A risk premium is an additional return that is paid for the high level of risk associated with the securities that investors have invested in. The risk premium represents the difference between the expected market return and the risk-free return. It is also used in the capital asset pricing model equation to determine the required return.
37,"If you buy an insurance policy with a high deductible and copayments, you would end up paying:",A higher premium,A lower premium,The premium of a low-risk individual,Both B and C.,D,"The correct answer is
D. Both B and C
-
lower premium and the premium of a low-risk individual
For insurance policy holders, if they have a lower premium, they will have a higher deductible in order to use the benefits of the insurance plan. Also, those with a lower premium tend to be low-risk individuals. For example, a newly licensed teenager who just got in a car accident will have a higher premium than an middle-aged adult without accidents on his/her record.","Premiums and Deductibles: Premiumsare the routine payment to maintain insurance coverage. This can be bi-yearly, monthly, or another time frame. Deductiblesare the amounts required to be paid by the customer with coverage before benefits of the insurance plan take effect."

b
is the correct answer.
Given information:
Expected return (Er) = 14%
Beta = 1.5
Expected return on the market portfolio (Rm) = 10%
The risk-free rate can be calculated by using the below formula.
Risk-free rate (Rf).
Computation of risk-free rate:
{eq}\begin{align*} {\rm{Er}} &= {\rm{Rf}} + {\rm{beta}} \times ({\rm{Rm}} - {\rm{Rf}})\\ 14\% &= {\rm{Rf}} + 1.5 \times (10\% - {\rm{Rf}})\\ {\rm{Rf}} &= 2\% \end{align*} {/eq}

2%.","Market Portfolio: The market portfolio frequently includes stocks, bonds, and other sorts of investable securities. It is frequently used as a benchmark for assessing the performance of mutual funds and investment portfolios."
39,"In a year in which common stocks offered an average return of 18%, Treasury bonds offered 10% and Treasury bills offered 7%, the risk premium for common stocks was:",1%.,3%.,8%.,11%.,D,"The answer is D.
The risk premium for the common stock is the expected return on the common stocks minus the risk free rate. The appropriate risk free rate is the return on treasury bills. Since the common stock return is 18% and the treasury bill return is 7%, so the risk premium = 18% - 7% = 11%.
The return on treasury bonds is not an appropriate proxy for the risk free rate, because treasury bonds are subject to maturity risks, thus its returns are not risk-free.",Risk Premium: Risk premium is the difference between the expected return on a risky asset and the risk free rate. The risk free rate is the expected return on an asset that is free of any kind of market risks.

42,"When the market risk premium rises, stock prices will:",rise,fall,recover,have excess volatility,B,"The answer is B. falls.  As the market risk premium rises, this means the difference between the return requirement for stocks and a risk-free assets has widened.  Therefore, stocks will be discounted at a greater rate that prior to the increase in the market risk premium.  The higher discount rate will lead to a greater discounting effect on future earnings, which means lower valuations.",Market Risk Premium: The market risk premium is a metric that indicates the return expected on the overall stock market less the return achievable on a risk-free asset.  It is a measure of the risk required for investing in the relatively volatile stock market.

a. The greater the interest rate risk, the larger the term premium.
c. The longer the time to maturity, the larger the term premium.
d. If there were no term premium, the interest rates would be lower on average.
The term premium, which is often referred to as the maturity risk premium or the interest rate risk premium, represents the increasingly large interest rate required by creditors for locking up their funds in increasingly longer-dated debt instruments.  The relationship holds, because longer-dated instruments are exposed to a higher degree of interest rate risk than shorter-duration instruments.  Moreover, if no premium existed, longer-dated instruments would carry the same interest rate as shorter-dated instruments, thereby lowering the average premium to zero.","Risk Premium: A risk premium is the additional compensation (return) investors require for assuming incremental risk on an investment.
