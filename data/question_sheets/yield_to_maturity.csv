2,"Which of the following $1,000 face value securities has the highest yield to maturity?","a 12% coupon bond selling for $1,100","a 10% coupon bond selling for $1,000","a 5% coupon bond selling for $1,000","a 12% coupon bond selling for $1,000",D,"The correct answer is option
D) a 12% coupon bond selling for $1,000
A bond is issued at the face value (i.e. $1,000) if the yield to maturity is the same as the stated coupon rate. On the other hand, if a bond is issued at a premium to the face value, the yield to maturity is less than the stated coupon rate in such a case.
Among the given options, the bond is selling at the face value for options B), C)  and D), and, hence, we can say that the respective yield to maturity is the same as the respective coupon rate (i.e. 10%, 5%, and 12% respectively). For option A), since the selling price (i.e. $1,100) is more than the face value, we can say that the yield to maturity is less than the coupon rate of 12%.
From the above explanation we can conclude that the highest yield to maturity is for option D), which is 12%.","Bond Yields: In the domain of accounting, the coupon rate for a bond is the quoted interest rate that dictates the periodic coupon or interest payments to the investors. On the other hand, the yield to maturity is the interest rate for which the issue price is the same as the sum of present values of all prospective interest payments and face value repayment."
3,"If a corporation were to choose between issuing a debenture, a mortgage bond, or a subordinated debenture, which would have the highest yield to maturity, everything else equal?",the debenture,the mortgage bond,the subordinated debenture,all of the above,C,"The correct option is (c)
.
A bond or a debt of an organization that ranks below then other bonds or debentures would be classified as subordinated debentures.
When a company is required to choose between issuing a debenture, a subordinated debenture, or a mortgage debenture, then it is said that the subordinated debenture would have the highest yield to maturity, everything else otherwise equal because senior securities are paid first in this case, whereas, if an organization is required to choose amongst them that would sell for the greatest price, then only the mortgage bond would be selected because in this case, the holders would have a claim on the real estate assets.
Hence, it is the correct option.","Financing Activities Financing activities are recorded and reported in one of the statements of financial reputation that is a cash flow statement.

{/eq}. The yield to maturity is:",greater than 7 percent.,7 percent.,less than 7 percent.,cannot be determined.,C,"The answer is
c) less than 7 percent.
Summary:
Par = $1,000
Coupon rate = 7%
Price =  $1,1,00
In this case, the price of this bond is greater than its par value, which indicates that the yield to maturity is less than the coupon rate. As the yield is less than the coupon rate, the present value of all cash inflows will increase greatly, which will exceed the par value.","Yield To Maturity: The yield to maturity (YTM) is an expected rate of return on a bond that an investor holds the bond until its maturity.

a. A one-year bond with a 6.7 percent interest today
To attract investors to purchase new bonds, these bonds would usually offer the coupon rate that is equal to the current yield to maturity. Considering this assumption, a bond with a higher coupon rate indicates that it yields at a higher rate of return.",Yield to Maturity: Yield to maturity (YTM) is the investor's expected rate of return by holding a bond until its maturity. The investor's forecast of future interest rates has a direct impact on deciding whether the bond should be purchased since any change in the market interest rates will influence the fair value of the bond.
10,The most widely used calculated measure of interest rate in bond markets is the:,coupon rate.,discount rate.,yield to maturity.,current yield.,C,"Correct Answer: Option c. yield to maturity.
Explanation:
Yield to maturity is the holding period return on a bond that is realized by holding the bond until maturity. It is the most widely used measure in the bond markets. The bond valuation is not possible if it isn't for the yield to maturity. The purchase price of a bond is equal to the present value of the future cash flows from the bond discounted at the yield to maturity.","Cost of Debt: The cost of issuing bonds to raise capital and invest in the business is called the cost of debt.

C) decrease dividends
.
The cash outflows of a firm can be reduced by using following measures:
1) Decreasing the dividends to be paid to the shareholders
2) Decreasing capital expenditures
3) Decreasing debt repayment
The depreciation expense is a non-cash item and therefore it does not affect the cash flows.","Cash Flows: In the parlance of finance, the cash flow statement is one of the four financial statements which may be prepared by any firm for a financial period.

As the statement of cash flows deals with different activities such as operations, investing, and financing, the management can think from different perspectives to increase their return. This classification gives the flexibility to decide on investments, operating expenses, and transactions related to shareholders and loans taken by the company, etc.
Incorrect options: A, B, C
A: In comparison with the income statement, cash flows are less manipulative. Most of the companies try to manipulate net income showing high profits or fewer expenses. But only some of the individuals manipulate cash flow statements by showing fewer operating expenses.
B: As Cash flow from operating activities is the vital activity that deals with the daily production level, it's important for the companies than financing activities.
C: As the classification rule includes operating, investing, and financing activities, the cash flows from operating activities can't be prevented from manipulation through this classification.

21,Which of the following is correct regarding the relationship between bond yield to maturity and value of bond?,"When the yield to maturity increases, the bond value decreases.","When the yield to maturity decreases, the bond value decreases.","When the yield to maturity increases, the bond value remains the same.","When the yield to maturity increases, the bond value increases.",A,"Correct Answer: Option a. When the yield to maturity increases, the bond value decreases.
Explanation:
There is an inverse relationship between the price of a bond and the yield to maturity. If the yield to maturity increases, the price of the bond decreases. Similarly, when the yield to maturity decreases, the price of the bond increases. We can conclude that option a is the best answer.",Yield To Maturity: The yield that a bondholder realizes by holding the bond until maturity is called yield to maturity. It is used to determine the bond's current value. The present value of the future cash flows related to the bond are discounted at the yield to maturity.

B is false.  Public companies are subject to higher disclosure standards and listing requirements.  This is considered a disadvantage of going public.
C. is true.  After the IPO, companies can easily issue more shares and raise more external equity.
D. is false.  Going public increases the company's exposure to sources of both equity and debt capital.",IPO: An initial public offering (IPO) is the first sale of common equity to the general public.

Option C) issuing 10-year versus 20-year bonds.
Explanation:
Financing decisions of a company involve evaluation of the type of source that should be used for raising capital and deciding the maturity period of the same. Financing decisions include whether the common stock should be issued, or debt securities, etc. These decisions help the company in raising capital in a way that the cost is minimum and the profits are maximum.","Capital Budgeting Decisions: Capital budgeting decisions require a company to evaluate various alternatives and whether they are worth the present capital expenditure or not. This is done by comparing the initial investment cost with the present value of cash flows that are expected from the investments.

25,"Generally, more use is made of short-term financing because:",short-term interest rates are generally lower than long-term interest rates.,most firms do not have basic access to the capital markets.,short-term financing is usually more predictable than long-term financing.,Both A and B.,D,"Answer:
D. Both A and B.
Most of the firms will prefer to use short-term sources of finances because:
The short-term sources of finances are mostly cheaper due to the low-interest rate.
In most cases, firms are blocked from accessing long-term sources of finances due to a lack of collateral.","Financing Methods: Aggressive Financing: In a firm, financing means mobilizing resources, especially cash, to facilitate business undertakings.

The penalties for not paying a dividend are not severe.,Preferred stock is the most preferred method of raising capital.,C,"The correct option is
C) Preferred stock dividends are flexible. The penalties for not paying a dividend are not severe.
Even though dividend on preferred stock is much stable than common stock, sometimes, in case, if the company lacks sufficient profit, it may disrupt the flow of dividend to preferred stockholders and under the preferred stock, there are no many consequences, like a penalty when the company defaults the payment of dividend to preferred stockholders.
The explanation for incorrect options:
Option A: Common stockholders are entitled to elect the board of directors and they can also manage the internal affairs of the company's management. Preferred stockholders have no role in it. Hence, it is an incorrect option.
Option B: Dividend distribution on the preferred stock has no tax advantage as it is not considered as the tax-deductible item. Generally, interest on debt capital is tax-deductible to investors. Hence, it is an incorrect option.
Option D: Preferred stock is one of the methods used by businesses to raise capital. Debt and equity capital are the most common form of capital utilized by firms. Hence, it is an incorrect option.","Stock Stock is a portion of a company that represents the ownership of the respective entity. It is available in various kinds, via equity and preferred stock and the owners of stock can be called the shareholder of the company."
27,Which of the following is NOT a reason why a firm's financial managers must take great care when making investment decisions?,These investment decisions determine whether the firm will add value for its owners.,These investments determine the long-term directions in which the company may move.,These investment decisions determine the corporation's mix of debt and equity.,These investment decisions typically involve substantial costs which must be carefully weighed against their potential benefits.,C,"The current statement is option C) These investment decisions determine the corporation's mix of debt and equity.
The investment decision is not a determent factor to decide the company's capital structure, which is prominent in taking the financing decision of a firm.
Option A: Investment decisions should add value to the company owners (shareholders). The future returns of the company ultimately depends on the selection of assets chose for investment in the investment decision. Based on the investment the company can improve the dividend distribution to its shareholders that eventually leads to an increase in the value of shareholders.
Option B: Investment decision helps a business to predict the long-term directions as the decision is to invest in suitable assets that covers long-term as well as short-term assets, by making use of the available resource of a business, which should benefit the company in future, otherwise, it leads to the wastage of resources.
Option D: The investment decision should balance the cost and benefit that arrives from the endowments. If the cost is more than the benefit, then the company would incur a loss in the future. So, adequate care must take before making an investment decision.",Financial manager A financial manager is an individual who controls the financial management of a business.

28,The preferred method of showing interest rates between competing instruments is the yield to maturity.,True,False,,,A,"The above statement is True.
The yield to maturity method shows interest rates between the competing instruments.
This is so because the yield to maturity reflects the return of the total rate that will occur by the bond's maturity by paying off the interest rates. The competing instruments are those the firm has promoted to attract consumers to purchase, and these instruments have to pay off timely when there is maturity. The increase in interest rate leads to an increase in yield to maturity.
Thus, it is shown that competing instruments yield to maturity when there is an increase in interest rate.","Maturity: The maturity of financial instruments is the final date of paying off loans, debts, and other interest of the instruments that an individual has acquired from the market. Some instruments have a fixed period to be paid off."

{eq}{\rm\text{YTM}} = \frac{{{\rm\text{C}} + \frac{{{\rm\text{FV}} - {\rm\text{PV}}}}{{\rm\text{n}}}}}{{\frac{{{\rm\text{FV}} + {\rm\text{PV}}}}{2}}}

{/eq}
Explanation for incorrect options:
a.	The present value of a bond's face value is not calculated rather the face value is deducted from the issue price to know the YTM.
b.	The sum of the present value of a bond's face value and interest is calculated to know the current price of the bond, not for Yield to maturity.
c.	 When all the future payments are equated with the bond's price, it is used to know whether the bond is undervalued or overvalued.","Bond Price: Also called fair price, it is calculated after discounting the interest payments and redeemable value with YTM or the required rate of return. If the fair value of a bond is higher than its current price, it is an overvalued bond and vice-versa."
