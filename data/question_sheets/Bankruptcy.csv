1,A creditor of a corporation holds:,"bonds sold by the corporation.  If the corporation experiences financial difficulties, stockholders are paid before bondholders.","stocks sold by the corporation.  If the corporation experiences financial difficulties, bondholders are paid before stockholders.","bonds sold by the corporation.  If the corporation experiences financial difficulties, bondholders are paid before stockholders.","stocks sold by the corporation.  If the corporation experiences financial difficulties, stockholders are paid before bondholders.",C,"The answer is ""c. bonds sold by the corporation. If the corporation experiences financial difficulties, bondholders are paid before stockholders.""
A creditor of a corporation holds bonds that have been sold by the corporation. A bond is a debt security that represents a loan made by the bondholder to the corporation. The corporation is obligated to pay the bondholder interest on the loan and to repay the principal amount of the loan when the bond matures.
If a corporation experiences financial difficulties and is unable to pay its debts, bondholders are paid before stockholders. This is because bondholders are considered creditors of the corporation, while shareholders are owners of the corporation. In the event of bankruptcy or liquidation, bondholders have a higher claim on the company's assets and must be paid before shareholders can receive any payment.","Corporations: A corporation is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its owners. It is a type of business organization that is owned by shareholders and managed by a board of directors. A corporation has many of the same legal rights and responsibilities as an individual, including the right to enter into contracts, incur debt, and issue securities. It is often referred to as a ""legal person"" and is subject to regulation by government agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States.",,,,
2,"Alco Inc. has assets of $100,000 and multiple bonds payable. Which of the following has the senior claim to Alco Inc.s assets in the event of bankruptcy?",Preferred stockholders.,Common stockholders.,Bondholders.,Owners.,C,"The correct answer is option c. Bondholders.
As a general, the highest priority of claims in times of bankruptcy is the external creditors, then the internal one. In the event of bankruptcy, bondholders have the senior claim to a company's assets compared to stockholders (preferred and common) and owners. This is because bonds are considered debts owed by the company, and debt holders have a higher priority in the repayment hierarchy during bankruptcy proceedings. After bondholders are paid, any remaining assets can be distributed to preferred stockholders, followed by common stockholders and, finally, owners (if any assets remain).
Accordingly, when we arranged the order of priority for the claim, the following is the order.
c. Bondholders.
a. Preferred stockholders.
b. Common stockholders.
d. Owners.
Therefore,
the correct answer is option c. Bondholders.","Bankruptcy: In business and finance, bankruptcy refers to legal steps through which individuals or businesses that are unable to repay their outstanding debts can seek financial relief and protection from their creditors.",,,,
3,Partnership creditors shall have priority in payments over those of the partners' separate creditors as regards the separate properties of the partners.,TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"This statement is
true.
Partnership creditors shall have priority in payments over those of the partners' separate creditors as regards the separate properties of the partners.
Creditors who are owed money directly from the partnership will have priority in receiving payments over the creditors of individual partners. The debts of the partnership will be settled first. If any funds remain, they may be disbursed to individual partners for further liquidation to their creditors.","Liquidation Prioritization: During liquidation, the judge and lawyers overseeing the process will determine who will receive the recovered funds. In many instances, the revenues generated during the liquidation process will be insufficient to cover all outstanding debts. Funds will be awarded based on a prioritization of who has first rights to liquidated funds.",,,,
4,True or false? Insolvency is a result of having more liabilities than assets.,TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The statement is true.
Insolvency alludes to the state of being incapable to pay the obligations, by an enterprise or  individual, at maturity. These circumstances appear when the assets are inadequate to pay off the liabilities or the liabilities exceed the resources. Thus, insolvency occurs when an indebted person cannot pay the obligations they owe.
In the United States, the solvency test is regulated by the law and two types of solvency tests are conducted, that is, balance sheet insolvency test and the cash flow insolvency test.","Liabilities A liability can be defined as something an individual or company owes. Liabilities are settled over time through the exchange of financial benefits, such as cash, merchandise, or financial assets.",,,,
5,Which of the following statements is true of the creditor's meetings?,These meetings should be held in the presence of a bankruptcy judge.,The only purpose of these meetings is the election of a permanent trustee.,Only the creditors and the trustee are allowed to attend these meetings.,An interim trustee is responsible for organizing these meetings.,D,"The correct option is an option (d)
.
Because the newly appointed interim trustee's first and most important task is to call a creditors' meeting. While giving a loan to anyone whether a person or an organization there is a need for an intermediary who becomes a witness to the transaction. For the creditor's meeting, a trustee is responsible to arrange the meeting and act as an interim trustee between both the parties. Trustees could be a person or an authorized member of a board that has the legal right to act as a custodian for a given asset.
Reason for incorrect options
:
Option (a) is incorrect
because the bankruptcy judge is not required to attend this conference because it is between the trustee and the creditors.
Option (b) is incorrect
because the meeting's objective is to file for bankruptcy and clear the debts owed to creditors.
Option (c) is incorrect
because the conference occurs between the trustee for the owner and the creditors.",Debtors and Creditors: Debtors are the ones who take money or loan from the organization and the amount becomes a debt on them that needs to be paid on time. While creditors are those who give money to the organization and this amount becomes a debt to the organization.,,,,
6,Who typically receives first priority when resources are divided as part of a business's liquidation?,Stockholders,Owners,Creditors,Managers,C,"The correct answer is option C: Creditors.
When a business is liquidated, the resources obtained from selling off its assets are distributed among the various entities that the business owes money to, and creditors are most always given first priority. According to the absolute priority rule in bankruptcy law, distribution of resources goes in the following order:
Secured and unsecured creditors
Stockholders
That is, only
after
satisfying all the debts and obligations to creditors are any remaining assets divided among stockholders or owners.
Below are the reasons why the other answer choices are incorrect.
Choice A:
Stockholders are individuals or companies that hold shares in the company. As mentioned above, the absolute priority rule lists them as second after creditors in order of asset distribution when a business is liquidated. Therefore, they receive second priority as opposed to first priority.
Choice B:
Most owners of a company are stockholders of the company. Hence, once again referring to the absolute priority rule, they receive second priority as opposed to first priority during liquidation.
Choice D:
Managers within a company are employees of that company. Hence, during a business liquidation, they don't generally receive any of the resulting resources. The only exception to this is if a manager holds stock in the company in which they are employed making them a shareholder, but managers in general do not receive any priority when dividing resources upon a businesses liquidation.","Business liquidation: Business liquidation is similar to individual bankruptcy, but it is specific to businesses. That is, when a business comes to a point where they can no longer meet their financial obligations, they may choose to liquidate. When this happens, the business liquidates its assets in order to pay those financial obligations that they otherwise could not. Closing of the business usually follows shortly after a liquidation.",,,,
46,A creditor is a person or business who:,has a payable to another party.,purchases goods on account.,invests money in the stock of a company.,has a receivable from another party.,D,"The correct option is
D. has a receivable from another party.
Creditors are persons or businesses that provide goods or services to the company on credit.  A business owes money to the creditor for the goods or services. Hence, creditors will have a receivable in the company's books. They are current liabilities of the business and appear on the balance sheet.
Explanation for other options:
A.  A debtor has a payable to another party.
B.  A debtor purchases goods on account.
C.  A stockholder invests money in the stock of a company.","Current Liabilities: Current liabilities appear on the balance sheet and have a credit balance. Current liabilities are used for calculating the working capital ratio, current ratio, acid-test ratio, etc.",,,,
54,"In a qualified reorganization, _____.",gain is generally deferred,only stock can be exchanged for stock,one corporation must acquire all the assets of another corporation,two or more corporations are always involved,C,"The correct answer is
c. one corporation must acquire all the assets of another corporation
A qualified reorganization is the merging or acquisition of one firm by another, involving the sale of all of a firm's assets, properties, and common shares and the compensation of its shareholders with either cash or financial securities. Therefore the correct answer is option c).
Explanations for the incorrect choices:
""a. gain is generally deferred"" is incorrect because, for gain from a reorganization to be deferred, the reorganization must meet specific conditions such as the acquirer being required to continue to operate the target company or to use most of the acquired assets in its business.
""b. only stock can be exchanged for stock ""is incorrect because, in a qualified reorganization, stockholders of the target firm can be compensated with either cash or new stocks in exchange for the sale of the target company's shares.
""d. two or more corporations are always involved"" is incorrect because a qualified reorganization typically involves no more than two companies.","Corporate Reorganization : Corporate reorganization refers to a number of transactions one of which is the sale, acquisition, or merging of companies, resulting in changes in the firms' ownership, management, or legal structure.",,,,
55,Match the following item for a bakery to the type of cost: Frosting.,Factory overhead,Non-manufacturing cost,Direct materials,Direct labor,C,"The correct answer is
c. Direct materials
.
Frosting on a cake is a part of the production of a cake and is a raw material used to make a cake. Therefore, it will be classified as a direct material cost for the bakery.
Note:
Direct labor and manufacturing overhead are also production costs, but frosting a cake doesn't come under these two cost types, and the frosting is a manufacturing cost.",Cost Types: Direct and indirect costs are both production costs necessary for converting raw materials into completed goods. The classification is based on how these costs can be traceable to the output produced.,,,,
56,"The balance sheet lists the company's assets, liabilities, and equity (including dollar amounts) as of a specific moment in time.",TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The statement is

57,The classified balance sheet will show which liability subsections.,current liabilities and other liabilities.,other liabilities and long-term liabilities.,current liabilities and long-term liabilities.,present liabilities and tomorrow's liabilities.,C,"The correct answer is
option c. current liabilities and long-term liabilities
A classified balance sheet refers to the format of the balance sheet that classifies the line items into categories. It separates the line items and presents them under the category relevant to the nature of the business, which helps the readers of the statement more clearly understand the financial position of the business. The common classifications under the liability subsections are current liabilities, long-term liabilities, and shareholders' equity.
Other options are incorrect.
Option a. current liabilities and other liabilities
: This is incorrect because other liabilities are not a classification of liabilities under a classified balance sheet.
Option b. other liabilities and long-term liabilities
: This is incorrect because the option omits the important classification of current liabilities.
Option d. present liabilities and tomorrow's liabilities
: This is incorrect because neither present liabilities nor tomorrow's liabilities are the classifications of liabilities in the classified balance sheet.",Liabilities: Liabilities are the company's owed capital which is to be repaid after or during the predetermined period. It can be broadly classified into two categories: current and noncurrent liabilities.,,,,
58,True or False: Accrued expenses are liabilities.,TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"True
It is true to say that accrued expenses are liabilities.
Expenses that a business has incurred but not yet paid for are known as accrued expenses. Even though the money hasn't been paid out yet, these expenses are counted and recorded in the books of accounts. Liabilities are amounts that the company is obligated to pay in the future and do so because of future expenses.
An electricity bill received in May by a business would be considered an accrued expense if the payment wasn't made until June. Since the business benefited from using the utility's power throughout the month, it is now responsible for compensating the utility for its services. Accrued expenses are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet until they are paid in full.
The term ""accrued expenses"" refers to the monetary commitments that the company has made as a result of transactions or activities that have occurred in the past. Since these obligations must be paid or settled in the future, they are classified as liabilities.","Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is the section of a company's financial report that details the company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. Stakeholders should pay close attention to the balance sheet since it is a key indicator of the company's financial health.",,,,
59,True or False: Deferred expenses are assets.,TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"True
Assets include deferred expenses, also referred to as prepaid expenses. Any expenditure that is paid in advance but has not yet been incurred is considered a deferred expenditure. Because they represent future financial benefits that the company will receive, these expenses initially appear as assets on the balance sheet. After some time has passed and the expense has been incurred, the corresponding asset is written down and recorded as a cost in income.
When a company pays its insurance premiums for an entire year in advance, for instance, the full amount of the premium is initially recorded as a prepaid insurance asset. Each month or quarter throughout the year, the prepaid insurance asset is reduced and expensed in proportion to the portion that has been used.","Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is the financial report that lists the short-term and long-term assets and liabilities, along with the shareholder's equity.

60,"True or False: Under a classified balance sheet, all liabilities are listed in one group.",TRUE,FALSE,,,B,"The statement is
false
because, under a classified balance sheet,
current and long-term liabilities are listed separately
.
The format of the classified balance sheet is:
Current assets + Long term assets = Total assets
this amount equals:
Current liabilities + Long-term liabilities = Total liabilities + Stockholders' equity = Total liabilities + stockholders' equity
The balance sheet format is called classified because current and long-term assets and liabilities are presented separately.","Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is a financial statement that lists the assets and liabilities of a company at a point in time. It, therefore, gives a snapshot of the financial position of the company on a date. It can be prepared using either the classified or non-classified formats.",,,,
61,"True or False: Under a classified balance sheet, assets are split into two groups.",TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The correct answer is true.
A classified balance sheet categorizes assets into current and non-current (or long-term) assets. Let us describe each as follows.
Current Assets: These are assets that the company expects to convert to cash, sell, or consume through normal operations within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. Examples include cash, accounts receivables, inventory, and prepaid expenses.
Non-Current Assets: Also known as long-term or fixed assets, these are not expected to be realized, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle like current assets. These include investments, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets like patents or trademarks, and long-term receivables.

Option A: When the auditor has also drafted some of the firm's accounts, there is a risk of self-review. This concern may be eradicated in large companies by splitting the accounting and auditing functions into two separate teams. Therefore, option A is not the correct choice.
Option B: If the auditor is active to promote the customer to the degree where their objectivity is threatened, it is described as an ""advocacy threat."" Therefore, option B gets ruled out.
Option C: The adverse interest threat implies that a member will not behave objectively because their interests conflict with those of the customer.
