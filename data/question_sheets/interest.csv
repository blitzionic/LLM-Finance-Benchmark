1,Which of the following is important when evaluating long-term investments?,Investments must earn a reasonable rate of return.,Employees are able to determine and propose capital equipment for their divisions or departments.,Proposals should match long-term goals.,All of the above.,D,"Explanation:
Correct Answer: d. All of the above.
As long-term investments are opted by the management to earn profits and income in long run, they generate higher returns associated with high risk. These investments include investments in assets that are used by the company in the long term. Hence, management also recommends investing in capital assets. As the main goal of long-term investments is to choose those that have a longer life, the proposals chosen should be matched with long-term goals.",Investments: When a person uses the money to invest in some kind of asset or other sources with an expectation of generating profit or income is referred to as an investment. Most of the investments are purchased for long-term use to capitalize on long-term profits.

8,The market interest rate is _____ than the _____ rate when the bond price is _____ its face value.,greater; discount; above,greater; coupon; below,greater; coupon; above,greater; perpetuity; above,B,"The correct answer is (b) - Greater; Coupon; below.
The sequence of Greater, Coupon and below between the interest rates and bonds is due to the following reasons. Firstly, the market rate is greater than prices attached to bonds since as the interest rate decreases, the bonds' prices also decrease. Secondly, the bonds' price is at par value when market interest rates equal the bond's coupon rate. As a result, if the rate of the coupon is below the rates of the market interest, it implies that the prices will be below the par value.","Market Interest: Market Interest refers to the dominant rate of interest that are accessible on cash deposits. Various factors that affect market interest includes inflow and outflow of funds in an economy, deposit sizes, and the duration of deposits. On the other hand, bonds refer to an instrument of a fixed income representing a loan given to a borrower from an investor (usually government or corporate)."

10,"An investment of $100,000 five years ago has accumulated to $200,000 now. The simple interest earned on the investment is equal to:",20.0%,13.8%,14.4%,8.0%,A,"The correct option is option A. 20%
To solve the problem posed, we will make use of the following simple interest formula:
$$A = P(1+rt) $$
In this formula,
P
is the initial amount invested in an account,
A
is the account balance after
t
years, and
r
is the simple interest rate in decimal form.
The information provided in the problem helps us to define the variables in this formula as follows:
Initial amount invested (
P
)= $100,000
Time (
t
) = 5 years
Account balance after 5 years (
A
) = $200,000
Interest rate in decimal form (
r
) = ?
Plugging these values into our simple interest formula, we have:
$$\$200,000 = \$100,000(1+5r) $$
We can solve this equation for
r
in order to find the interest rate in decimal form. This goes as follows:
$$\begin{align} \$200,000 &= \$100,000(1+5r)\\[0.3cm] \dfrac{\$200,000}{\$100,000} &= \dfrac{ \$100,000(1+5r)}{\$100,000} &\left[\text{Divide both sides by } \$100,000\right]\\[0.3cm] 2 &= 1 + 5r &\left[\text{Simplify}\right]\\[0.3cm] 2 - 1 &= 1 + 5r - 1 &\left[\text{Subtract }1 \text{ from both sides}\right]\\[0.3cm] 1 & = 5r &\left[\text{Simplify}\right]\\[0.3cm] \dfrac{1}{5} &= \dfrac{5r}{5} &\left[\text{Divide both sides by }5\right]\\[0.3cm] 0.2&=r &\left[\text{Simplify}\right] \end{align} $$
We get
r
= 0.2, so this is our interest rate in decimal form. Converting this to percentage form by multiplying it by 100% gives:
0.2 × 100% = 20%
Thus,
the correct interest rate is option A. 20%
.","Simple Interest: Simple interest is a type of interest that is very simple to calculate, because the interest amount is calculated only on the invested amount and remains the same throughout the investment period.

11,Thomas invests $121 in an account that pays 6 percent simple interest. How much money will Thomas have at the end of 4 years?,$144.11,$150.04,$157.30,$142.78,B,"Correct Answer:
Option b. $150.04.
We should first determine the simple interest for 4 years:
Simple interest for 4 years = Investment amount × Interest rate × Number of years
Simple interest for 4 years = $121 × 6% × 4 years
Simple interest for 4 years = $29.04
The next step is to determine the amount Thomas will have at the end of 4 years:
Amount at the end of 4 years = Investment amount + Simple interest for 4 years
Amount at the end of 4 years = $121 + $29.04
Amount at the end of 4 years = $150.04","Simple Interest: To determine the simple interest, we should compute the product of the principal amount, interest rate, and period.

12,An investment earning simple interest is preferred over an investment earning compound interest because the simplicity adds value.,True,False,,,B,"The correct option is false.
An investment earning simple interest is not preferred over an investment earning compound interest. Compound interest over simple interest is preferable because it allows funds to grow faster than the simple interest rate. Interest earned in the compound interest formula is more because the interest is calculated at a larger amount than simple interest. In compound interest, the interest is calculated on the principal plus interest amount.",Simple interest: Simple interest is the compensation paid to the investor by the borrower on the borrowed money. It is calculated by multiplying the product with the interest rate and the time money is borrowed.

6.521%.
To calculate the equivalent annual simple rate of interest, find the interest earned over the three years and divide it by the initial principal.
The formula for calculating the compound interest is:
Here,
A (the final amount)
P (principal amount) = $1,000,
r (annual interest rate (as a decimal) = 6% or 0.06
n the number of times the interest is compounded per year = 4 (since the interest is compounded quarterly)

Explanation:
Note that under the simple interest method, the interest expense is the same for every period.
Step 1:
Interest amount per period = (Current value of the investment - Initial investment) / Investment period
Interest amount per period = ($8,050 - $7,000) / 4
Interest amount per period = $262.50
Step 2:
Yearly interest rate = Interest amount per period / Initial investment
Yearly interest rate = $262.50 / $7,000

.
To determine the total amount due on the loan described in the problem, we will make use of the simple interest formula. This formula states that if
P
dollars is borrowed at a simple interest rate of
r
% for
t
years, then the total amount of interest that will be paid on the loan is:
$$\text{Total Interest}=Prt $$
It is important to note that in this formula,
r
represents
r
% in decimal form.
First, let's identify our variables using the information provided in the problem.
Initial amount borrowed (
P
) = $1,000
Time period (
t
) = 8 years
Simple interest rate (
r
) = 0.15 (this is 15% in decimal form)
Plugging
P
= $1,000,
r
= 0.15, and
t
= 8 into our simple interest formula, we can calculate the total amount of interest to be paid on the loan.
$$\begin{align} \text{Total Interest}&=Prt \\[0.2cm] \text{Total Interest}&=\$1,000 \times 0.15 \times 8 &\left[\text{Plug in }P = \$1,000,\; r=0.15,\text{ and }t=8\right]\\[0.2cm] \text{Total Interest}&=\$1,200 \end{align} $$
We see that the total interest paid on the loan is $1,200. Thus, to find the total amount due at the end of loan term we add the initial amount borrowed ($1,000) and the total amount of interest paid ($1,200).
$$\begin{align} \text{Amount Due}&=\text{Amount Borrowed} + \text{Total Interest}\\[0.2cm] \text{Amount Due}&=\$1,000 + \$1,200\\[0.2cm] \text{Amount Due}&=\$2,200 \end{align} $$

31,The principal of a simple interest note is the difference between its maturity value and interest.,True,False,,,A,"Correct Answer:
Option a) True
,
Simple interest equals the product of the principal amount, time, and interest rate. The method does not charge interest on accrued interest as in the case of the compound interest method. The maturity value of a note with simple interest is expressed as follows:
Maturity value of a note = Principal or face value + Total interest
On rearranging the equation, we have:
Principal or face value = Maturity value of a note - Total interest
Therefore we can conclude that the difference between the maturity value of a note and the simple interest on it equals the principal value.",Interest Expense: Interest expense is a charge that should be paid against the amount borrowed for various reasons. It is a non-operating expense reported on an income statement. We must accrue interest once it incurs though the payment is not made.

A loan is usually introduced with an Annual Percentage Rate (APR), which includes interest charges and other fees within a year. Note that the APR excludes the effects of compounding interest.
B. Incorrect. A loan will not be quoted with a compound rate since it makes the loan more expensive compared to other available loans from different lenders.
C. Incorrect. The effective annual interest rate reflects the true financing cost of a loan, which makes the loan more expensive. Thus, lenders will not usually introduce an effective annual interest rate to borrowers.
D. Incorrect. The simple interest rate includes the interest charge only while some other fees should be exposed to borrowers as well. Hence, the simple interest rate is not relevant.","Interest Rate: An interest rate on an investment refers to the expected rate of return that an investor can earn by holding the investment within a given period.

Option A. 5 percent.
Since the loan is just a simple loan, it means to say that we will use the basic formula in computing the interest.
I = 22,050 - 20,000 = 2,050
P = 20,000
t = 2
I = Prt
2,050 = 20,000 * r * 2
r = 2,050 / 40,000
r = .05125 or approximately 5%
We can validate our answer by using 5% as our interest rate.
I = Prt
Year 1 - Interest = (20,000*0.05*1)
Year 1 - Interest = 1,000
Total Amount Payable - Year 1 = 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000
Now, for Year 2 interest, we can have the following;
Year 1 - Interest = (21,000*0.05*1)
Year 2 - Interest = 1,050
Total Amount Payable - Year 2 = 21,000 + 1,050 = 22,050","Simple Interest: Simple interest is the most basic computation of interest payable or receivable on the debtor's money and lends by the creditor. The interest is computed as the product of principal, rate, and time or period."
41,Interest that is calculated using only the principal is called:,Add-on interest.,Effective interest.,Compound interest.,Simple interest.,D,"The correct answer is
d. Simple interest.
Interest that is calculated using only the principal is called simple interest. In this type of investment, the investors get a fixed amount of interest every year, and it remains constant until the investment matures.

The other options are incorrect.
a. Add-on interest: In add-on interest, the interest amount is added to the principal and then divided by the number of payment periods. So here, interest is also involved, which makes it an important option.
b. Effective interest: Effective interest is used in compounding interest, where the principal amount plus interest from last year becomes the principal amount for the existing year. So this is the incorrect option.
c. Compound interest: In compound interest, the interest amount of the previous year is also added to the calculation of the current year's interest.
