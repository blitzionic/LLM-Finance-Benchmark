id,question,A,B,C,D,Answer,Explanation,Hint
1,Net present value is calculated by using the:,Accounting income.,The required rate of return.,The IRR.,The future value of cash flows.,D,"The correct option is
Option d: The future value of cash flows
Option a: In the calculation of NPV, it requires the present value of future cash flow, which is compared with the initial cash flow. On the other hand, the accounting income represents the profit after deducting taxes from the entire sales revenue. So, this is the wrong option.
Option b: In the calculation of NPV, WACC is considered as the discount rate as it is used by the company to judge if the project is profitable to invest in, whereas the required rate of return is used by investors to determine the minimum expected return they can earn from invested stock. Therefore the option is not correct.
Option c: The internal rate of return is used to derive the annual rate of growth that is expected to be generated from the project. This is also one of the methods used in capital budgeting. This is the wrong option.
Option d: The future value of the cash flows is used to calculate NPV based on the comparison of their present worth against the initial cash flow.
Formula
{eq}\text{NPV}=\sum\limits_{\text{n}=1}^{\text{n}}{\frac{\text{Cash flow in period n}}{{{\left( 1+\text{Discount Rate} \right)}^{n}}}-\text{Initial investment}}

Therefore, Option d is the correct answer.",Capital Budgeting: Capital budgeting is a process used by businesses to determine the risk and anticipated long-term return of the projects in which they wish to invest. One of the methods that fall under capital budgeting is the Net Present Value.
2,"In order to calculate the net present value (NPV) of a capital investment, you must know:",the net accounting income generated from the investment,the initial outlay and the incremental cash flow,the rate of return generated on similar investments,None of the above.,B,"Correct Answer:
Option b. the initial outlay and the incremental cash flow
.
The net present value formula can be expressed as:
Net present value = Investment outlay - Present value of annual cash flows
Options
Analysis
a. the net accounting income generated from the investment
Net income is not relevant in calculating NPV as it uses the time value of money.
b. the initial outlay and the incremental cash flow
The initial outlay should be known, but the incremental cash flows needn't be.
c. the rate of return generated on similar investments
The rate of return on similar investments should be known along with the investment period, investment cost, and annual cash flows.",Net Present Value: The net present value technique is one of the most famous capital budgeting tools that help businesses with investment decisions. The method uses the time value of money in its calculations.

5,"At the termination of the project, which of the following needs to be considered relating to project assets?",Salvage value.,Book value.,Intrinsic value.,Fair value.,A,"The answer is
a. Salvage value.
a. Correct. Salvage value presents the value received by selling the asset at the end of the project, which is an additional cash inflow to the terminal cash flow. Hence, it should be included in an Net Present Value (NPV) analysis, which is a capital budgeting technique.
b. Incorrect. The book value of an asset indicates the remaining accounting value after all associated depreciation. It does not reflect the true value of the asset.
c. Incorrect. The asset's intrinsic value represents how much the asset is worth today. Thus, the intrinsic value should not be included in the terminal cash flow.
d. Incorrect. The fair value also represents the present value of the asset. So, it should not be included in the terminal cash flow.","Capital Budgeting: The capital budgeting process is necessary in a business for selecting profitable projects or investments. For instance, a firm can analyze a fixed asset purchase by comparing its expected cash inflows and initial costs."

7,"Using net present value, a project is rejected if it is:",Equal to zero.,Positive.,Negative.,Less than the hurdle rate.,C,"The answer is
c. Negative.
Net present value:
Net present value = Present value of expected cash inflows - Present value of all cash outlays
A positive NPV indicates that the expected earnings are sufficient to recoup all required investments.
A negative NPV will reject the project since there is a loss, in this case, considering the time value of money.
A zero NPV makes the firm indifferent in selecting or rejecting a project as the project breaks even in this case.
It is irrelevant to compare the NPV with the hurdle rate, or the cost of captain since the NPV represents the actual dollar value while these two rates are measured in term of percentage.","Net Present Value (NPV): The net present value approach is a common capital budgeting that guides a firm's managers in analyzing and selecting profitable projects from a pool of available projects.

This is an incorrect statement. A zero present worth indicates that all cash inflows are equal to all cash outflows, considering the effects of the time value of money. Hence, the future worth of a project will be zero if its present worth is zero.
b) This is a correct statement. A zero present worth indicates that the project generates no value for the company. In other words, all cash inflows are sufficient to recoup the required outlays.
c) This is a correct statement. A zero present-worth project will not damage the firm's value. Hence, investors will be indifferent to accepting or rejecting the project.
d) This is a correct statement.

If a project's net present value (NPV) is equal to zero, it means that the present value of cash inflows is sufficient to recover the project's cash outlays. In this case, the discount rate should be the project's internal rate of return (IRR) according to the definition of the IRR.
A. Payback period
is incorrect because the payback period method measures the length of time to recover the initial cash outlays.
C. Average accounting return
is incorrect because the average accounting return (ARR) is a nominal measure of return in term of percentage. It is not a relevant discount rate for the net present value technique.
D. Profitability index

Option b. $22,511
.
An investment's net present value should be positive to be profitable. The net present value computation requires discounting the annual cash flows to the present and comparing the same with the initial outlay.
Even cash flows can be discounted using the following formula:
{eq}PV_{oa}=A×\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}\\

PV_{oa}=$50,000 × \frac{1\,-\,(1\,+\,0.12)^{-10}}{0.12}\\

PV_{oa}=$50,000 × 5.650223\\

PV_{oa}= \,$282,511

{/eq}
Where,
{eq}PV_{oa} = \text{Present Value of ordinary annuity}\\

A = \text{Amount of annuity payment} = $50,000\\

r = \text{interest rate} = 12\%\\

n = \text{number of time periods} = 10\\

{/eq}
Using the above calculation, the net present value can be calculated as follows:
Net present value = Present value of cash flows - Investment cost
Net present value = $282,511 - $260,000
Net present value = $22,511
An investment with a positive net present value can be accepted
.",Investment Analysis: An investment should be considered if it is profitable for the business. Investment profitability analysis is possible using capital budgeting techniques. The time value of money plays an essential role in investment analysis.
30,"Suppose you will receive a payment of $500 one year from now. If during the year the interest rate rises, this decreases the present value of your future payment.",True,False,,,A,"The correct answer is option
a. True
.
The present value of the future payment is computed as:
{eq}\begin{align*}

&=  \dfrac{\text{Amount to be received after 1 year}}{\text{(1 + annual interest rate)} ^ {\text{Number of years}}} \\[0.3 cm]

&= \dfrac{FV}{(1 + r\%)^{1}}\\[0.3 cm]

&= \dfrac{FV}{(1 + r\%)}

\end{align*}

{/eq}
From the above formula, it is clear that the present value is inversely related to the interest rate and hence, the present value will decrease if the interest rate rises.",Present Value: The concept of the time value of money is useful in coming up with the present value of an expected payment. One can even determine the expected future value of a deposit made today by using this concept.

b. - Intrepretation
The correct option is (3).
The net present value is negative, and this means that the project does not meet the company's required rate of return therefore the rate of return is
less than 12%
If the net present value is $0, it means the project's rate of return equals the required rate of return, and if the net present value is positive, it implies that the project exceeds the required rate of return and that the project is therefore acceptable.",Net Present Value: A proposed investment's net present value is the sum of all its discounted cash flows. The technique is used in capital budgeting to access proposed investments because it uses all future cash flows and considers the time value of money.

34,Suppose an investment has cash inflows of R dollars at the end of each year for two years. The present value of these cash Inflows using a 12% discount rate will be:,greater than under a 10% discount rate.,less than under a 10% discount rate.,equal to that under a 10% discount rate.,sometimes greater than under a 10% discount rate and sometimes less; It depends on R.,B,"The answer is
option B.
Let's assume R, periodic cash flows of $10,000, to determine the present value using the discount rates (r) of 12% and 10%, and the number of periods (n) is 2.
At 12%, the present value would be as follows.
{eq}\begin{align}

\text{PV}&=\text{R}\times\dfrac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}\\

&=\$10,000 \times\dfrac{1-(1+0.12)^{-2}}{0.12}\\
