How much interest expense would AT&T recognize on the income statement in the first year? Is this the same or different than the promised annual cash payments? Explain.",,A,"a. Identify the relevant variables:
Face Value
FV = $6,000,000
Stated Rate
SR = 5% / 2 = 2.5%
Interest Payment
PMT = $6,000,000 x 2.5% = $150,000
Number of Periods
N = 3 years x 2 = 6 periods
b. If the going rate of interest is 5%, how much cash will AT&T receive when they issue the bond.
If stated rate and the market rate is the same, the bond will be issued at its face value. Bonds are issued at a discount when market rate is higher than the stated rate and bonds are issued at a premium when stated rate is higher than the market rate. Therefore, at a 5% going rate, AT&T will receive $6,000,000 cash.
c. Given the information in part b, create an amortization schedule for the first two years. How much interest expense would AT&T recognize on the income statement in the first year? Is this the same or different than the promised annual cash payments? Explain.

AT&T will recognize a total interest expense of $300,000 in the first year. As you can see, the interest expense and the interest payment is the same since the stated rate and going rate of the bond is the same. Expense and payment will only differ when stated rate and market rate also differ.","Interest Expense and Interest Payment Interest expense recognized and interest payment made is not always the same. Interest payment is based on the stated rate of the bond. It is the actual cash disbursed to pay off the interest. On the other hand, interest expense is based on the market rates and is the accurate measure of interest incurred from the issuance of the bond."
2,"Note Payable of $6,000 represents a loan that was taken on June 1, 2019 at a yearly interest rate of 10%. The adjusting entry required on Aug 318, 2019 will be:","Cash $200, credit Note Payable $200","Debit Interest Payable $100, credit Interest Expense $100","Debit interest expense $150, credit Interest Payable $150","Debit cash $100, credit Interest Payable $100",C,"The correct option is
(c) Debit interest expense $150, credit Interest Payable $150
As the loan was taken on June 1, 2019, at an interest rate of 10%. On Aug 31, 2019, we should book interest expenses for three months.
{eq}\begin{align}

\text{Interest Expense} &= \text{Loan Amount} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \dfrac{\text{Number of months}}{12}\\

&= \$6,000 \times 0.10 \times \dfrac{3}{12}\\

&= \$600 \times \dfrac{1}{4}\\

Explanation for incorrect answers
The cash account will not be involved in the adjusting entry, hence options (a) and (d) are incorrect.
The interest payable account would be credited, hence option (b) is incorrect.",Interest Expense: The interest expense is the cost of funds for loans and borrowings. The interest rate is decided upfront between the lender and the borrower. Payment of interest is a cash outflow under financing activities.
3,"The interest on a $6,000, 6%, 60-day note receivable is:",$60.,$240.,$40.,$80.,A,"Answer: a. $60.
Explanation:
The interest on a $6,000, 6%, 60-day note receivable can be computed by using the following formula:
Interest = P X R X T
P = Principal amount = $6,000
R = Annual interest rate = 6%
T = Period of time in years = 60 days / 360 days
Interest = $6,000 * 6% * 60 days / 360 days
Interest =
$60","Interest Interest on a note is computed using the formula; Interest = P X R X T. ""P"" is the principal amount of the note, ""R"" is the annual interest on the note and ""T"" is the period of time expressed in terms of years."
4,"If Jackson sells $100,000 8% bonds when the market is 5%. The bonds will mature in 10 years. Interest is paid semi-annually. The bond interest payments will be?",$8000,$4000,none of the above,,B,"The bond interest payments will be
b. $4,000
The cash bond interest payment is calculated using the face value of the bond and the coupon interest rate. The interest is paid semi-annually so we must adjust it for 6 out of 12 months:
Face value of the bonds
$100,000
Coupon interest rate
8%
Semi-annual interest payment
= Face value × Coupon interest rate × 6/12
= $100,000 × 0.08 × 6/12
= $4,000","Bond Interest Payment: The bond interest payment is the cash paid to bondholders periodically. The interest rate and payment terms stated on the bond's issue documents are used to calculate the interest payment. When bonds are issued at a discount or a premium, the interest payment is not the same as the interest expense."
5,What does the term structure of interest rates refer to?,The fact that long-term interest rates are always higher than short-term interest rates,The relationship between bond maturities and interest rates,Why the expectations theory and liquidity preference theory are contradictory,None of the above,B,"The term structure of interest rates, also known as the yield curve, refers to
b. The relationship between bond maturities and interest rates
. In general, the yields or interest rates will increase as the maturities increase. This relationship exists due to increased risk over time. Conversely, yields or interest rates will decrease as the maturities decrease. This normal relationship exists when the economy is in an expansionary stage. If this slope of relationship reverses, the economy is in or heading into a recessive stage.","Interest: Interest refers to an amount paid to a lender in exchange for their capital. Interest is expressed as a percentage, and the interest to be paid is calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the stated interest rate for the applicable period. Interest rates have a positive correlation to risk, meaning that as risk increases so do interest rates, and vice-versa."
6,Accrued interest on a note is recorded by a debit to Interest Expense on the maker's books and a credit to Interest Revenue on the payee's books.,True,False,,,A,"The answer is
TRUE
Accrued Interest affects 2 parties, the debtor and the creditor.
For the debtors book, the journal entry is:

7,Soiling the bonds at a premium has the effect of:,raising the effective interest rate above the stated interest rate.,attracting Investors that are willing to pay a lower rate of interest than on similar bonds.,causing the interest expense to be higher than the bond interest paid.,causing the interest expense to be lower than the bond interest paid.,D,"Option 'd' is the correct answer.
If the bonds are issued at a discount, the amortized discount on the bonds payable is added to the bond interest paid. If the bonds are issued at a premium, the amortized premium on the bonds payable is subtracted from the bond interest paid.
If the bonds are sold at a premium, the interest expense would be less than the bond interest paid since the amortized premium would be subtracted from the bond interest paid for calculating interest expense.","Interest expense: A company's borrowed cash charge is called an interest expense. A non-operating item that appears on the income statement is interest expense. The interest must be paid on all borrowings, including bonds, loans, convertible debt, and credit lines."
8,"The interest on a $10,000, 6%, 60-day note receivable is",$680,$100,$300,$200,B,"The answer is
b. $100.
In this problem, the note's principal amount is $10,000, its interest rate is 6%, and the time is 60 days.
So, the interest is:
{eq}\begin{align}

\text{Interest} &= \text{Principal x Rate x Time in days over number of days in a year} \\

&=\$10,000 \times 6\% \times \frac{60}{360}\\

9,"Interest on a $5,000, 15% promissory note for six months is:",$3.75.,$375.,"$3,750.",$37.50.,B,"The correct answer is
b. $375
.
The interest rate on a promissory note always implies an annual rate. In the given case:
Face value of the note = $5,000
Annual interest rate = 15%
Interest period = 6 months
We need to compute the interest applicable for six months, not one year. The following formula will help arrive at the same:
{eq}\text{Interest for six months} = \text{Face value of the note × Interest rate} × \dfrac{6}{12} = {\$5,000 × 15\%} × \dfrac{6}{12} = \$375 {/eq}",Interest: Interest is a cost when the business borrows money and income when it lends money. Interest computations help determine the expense for the period a company must pay its creditors or accrue the same to pay on maturity.
10,"To charge customers interest on overdue accounts, you need to:",enter the interest rate charges in the customer's ledger record and Sage 50 Accounting will automatically create an invoice for the interest charge when the account is overdue.,"enter the interest rate charges as ledger settings, print statements and create invoices for the interest amounts on the statements.",calculate the amount of interest owed and create an invoice for this amount.,print and send out customer statements and enter the receipts when the customers pay the interest charges.,B,"The correct answer is option
b. enter the interest rate charges as ledger settings, print statements and create invoices for the interest amounts on the statements
Explanation
To charge customers interest on overdue accounts, following steps are followed:
Turn on the Sage 50 Accounting setting that charges interest on late payments. Invoices will only become overdue from the time you enable this feature.
Generate customer statements for those customers with overdue payments. The interest on the overdue balances for each customer are printed on their statements.
Create a new sales invoice for the interest amount owing.
When payment is received for the interest owed, enter the payment against the interest invoice. Sage 50 Accounting will continue to calculate interest on the original overdue invoice until payment is received for it.","Overdue Interest Sometimes the interest is charged on the overdue amount payable by the customer because of the delay in payment by such customers. To charge interest in Sage 50 Accounting, first of all the interest on overdue account should be entered in the ledger and then the statements on for each customer is printed and a new invoice for the interest amount is generated."
11,"Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, thus",increasing foreign direct investment.,increasing disposable income.,decreasing domestic tax rates.,reducing the amount of real investment undertaken in an economy.,D,"The correct answer to the given question is option
D. reducing the amount of real investment undertaken in an economy.
An increase in the cost of borrowing due to higher interest rates usually discourages new domestic and foreign investment as the sponsors of projects have to pay more cost for borrowing. In other words, the real investment undertaken in an economy reduces as the sponsors can undertake lower number of projects for the same value (i.e. principal + interest costs).","Cost of Capital: In the parlance of economics and finance, various projects are usually undertaken by having two sources of funds, namely, equity financing and debt financing. The overall cost of capital for a project is ascertained by taking a weighted average value of the proportion and costs of these funds."
12,"The interest accrued on $4,800 at 7% for 75 days is:",$168.,$34.,$70.,$39.,C,"Answer: c) $70.
The interest accrued on $4,800 at 7% for 75 days is computed as follows:
Interest = Principal * Annual Interest Rate * Number of Days Outstanding / Number of Days in a year
Interest = $4,800 * 7% * 75 days / 360 days
Interest = $70","Interest Interest are additional income or payment related to the use of money of others. Common assets that earn interest are cash, loan receivable and notes receivable."
13,"When interest rates go up, people are:",More likely to borrow,Less likely to borrow,Does not affect a person's consumption,None of the above.,B,"The correct answer is B. Less likely to Borrow
Explanation:
People will avoid taking out loans in these situations because rising interest rates will increase loan costs; instead, they will adopt saving habits and reduce their consumption and expenditures.
The other options are incorrect because:
Option A: If loan interest increases, it will not attract the borrowers because the costs associated with repaying the loan will rise. And hence, the choice is unwise.
Option C is untrue because interest rates must impact people's spending and consumption.","Interest Rate According to the borrower, the interest rate is the percentage of the loan amount, that the lender charges over and above the principal amount. The interest is usually paid in installments."
14,"Firewood Company signed a three-year note payable for $45,000 at 7% annual interest.

15,The interest charge on a simple loan is the difference between its maturity value and principal.,True,False,,,A,"It is
a.true
that the interest charge on a simple loan is the difference between its maturity value and principal.
The interest charge is usually expressed as an annual percentage that is determined on the principal over time. The interest charge is an expense that is deducted against the revenues generated by the loan over the period the borrowed capital is used.",Interest: The value of money changes depending on when cash can be received. A dollar today is worth more by virtue of the holder's ability to spend it than a dollar at some future date and this is the time-value of money that must be considered when money is loaned or invested.

I = 7%",Compound Interest Compound Interest is an interest which earns interest. Suppose we invest $100 in an investment and earned 10% interest on it i.e. $10 ($100 * 10%) Now for the next year we would not only earn interest on $100 but also on $10 i.e. we would earn interest on $110. This is compounding of interest hence the interest such calculated is called compound interest.

If the personal tax rate on income from bonds is equal to the personal tax rate on income from stocks, investors should be indifferent to the source of their income.  However, debt could still have a relative capital structure cost advantage over equity, if the corporate tax rate shows favor to debt (i.e. tax deductibility of interest expense).","Tax Deductibility of Interest Expense: In many tax jurisdictions, including that of the United States, debt is granted a tax advantage over equity capital.

20,The Balance Sheet would disclose the interest owed:,nowhere on the Balance Sheet.,in the Stockholder's Section.,in the Asset section.,in the Liabilities section.,D,"Correct Answer: Option D. in the Liabilities section.
Explanation:
Interest owed represents the amount of interest that has been incurred and not yet been paid for. To account for the same, an adjusting entry is made which requires recognition of the expense for the period and also the creation of a current liability called interest payable. Hence the amount of interest owed is shown under the liabilities side of the balance sheet.","Cost of Debt: When a company borrows debt, it has to pay interest on the debt.

31,Which of the following is a true statement regarding interest calculation methods?,Interest is calculated on either a straight basis or a delayed basis.,Interest is calculated on either a straight basis or an undiscounted basis.,"If a borrower receives a loan on a discount basis, the APR will be less than the simple interest.","If a borrower receives a loan on a discount basis, the APR will be more than the simple interest rate.",D,"The correct answer is d. If a borrower receives a loan on a discount basis, the APR will be more than the simple interest rate.
The discount basis method of loan deducts interest and related charges from the loan amount. The borrower is required to borrowed amount including interest and other charges. The annual percentage rate will be high as it is calculated on the full amount whereas the loan amount received is less. The borrower has to pay interest on more amount than the amount it is utilizing.
Explanation for incorrect answers:
a. Interest is calculated on either a straight basis or a delayed basis.
Interest is calculated on either simple method or compound method.
b. Interest is calculated on either a straight basis or an undiscounted basis.
The discounted and undiscounted methods are used to calculate the amount of money to be lent to the borrower. The charges are either deducted from principal amount or not.
c. If a borrower receives a loan on a discount basis, the APR will be less than the simple interest.
The APR will be high as the interest is paid on the amount which is more than the amount that is received by the borrower.","Interest Calculation: Interest is the charge to be paid on the borrowed money, calculated as a percentage of principal amount.

32,"Ahmad receives a $14,000, 12%, 60-day note. The maturity value of the note is:",$280,"$14,000","$14,280","$13,780",C,"Correct Answer:
Option c. $14,280
.
Ahmad should first determine the total interest on the note:
{eq}\text{Interest on the note} = \dfrac{\text{Face value of the note × Interest rate }}{\text{Total period}} × \text{ Interest period}= \dfrac{\$14,000 × 12\%}{360\,days} × 60\,days  = \$280

{/eq}
Now, the maturity value of the note can be computed as follows:
Maturity value of the note = Face value of the note + Total interest
Maturity value of the note = $14,000 + $280
Maturity value of the note = $14,280",Maturity Value: A note's maturity value refers to the total amount receivable at maturity. This amount consists of the face value and the interest due on the note for the note period. Interest computation depends on the note and interest periods.
33,A government will have an overall deficit that is smaller than its primary deficit if:,the government's net interest payments are positive.,government investment is negative.,government investment is positive.,the government's net interest payments are negative.,D,"The correct option is
d. The government's net interest payments are negative
.
We know that
Primary Deficit = Fiscal Deficit - Interest paid on debts
In this case, the overall fiscal deficit is higher than the primary deficit; therefore, it can be concluded that the interest paid on the debts are negative.","Interest payment: In finance and economics, the term interest payment refers to interest paid on the principal sum of money borrowed from a financial institution by the borrower.

The inputs needed for interest computation include the following:
Face value of the note = $8,000
Annual interest rate = 6%
The inputs are arranged logically to arrive at the interest expense as shown below:
{eq}\text{Annual Interest} = \text{Face value of the note × Interest rate} = {\$8,000 × 6\%} = \$480 {/eq}",Interest Rate: Interest rate is essential to determine the interest on the borrowed amount that needs to be paid along with the face value of the note at maturity. The rate is determined at the time of discussing the loan.
35,A debit to BIE_ that account.,increases,decreases,remains the same,,A,"Answer: A. increases
Interest Expense is an expense account presented in the income statement and decreases the amount of net income. Since it is an expense account, the normal balance of the said account is debit. Thus, the debit in interest expense account increases the said account.",Bond Interest Expense: Bond interest expense can be computed by obtaining the principal amount and multiplying it to the nominal interest rate applicable in the bonds and the timers or time on which said liability is outstanding.
36,"When the spread between interest rates on RSA and RSL __________, the bank's net interest income would be expected to __________.",increases; increase,increases; decrease,decreases; increase,B and C,A,"The correct answer is
A) increases; increase
.
Rate-Sensitive Assets (RSA) are financial assets held by a bank or financial institution that are subject to changes in interest rates. These assets typically include loans, investments, and other interest-earning assets. Rate-Sensitive Liabilities (RSL) are the liabilities of a bank or financial institution that are subject to changes in interest rates. These liabilities usually include deposits and borrowings.
The spread between interest rates on RSA and RSL refers to the difference between the interest rates that a bank earns on its Rate-Sensitive Assets and the interest rates it pays on its Rate-Sensitive Liabilities. This spread directly impacts the bank's net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on assets and the interest expense paid on liabilities.
A larger spread between the interest rates on RSA and RSL means that the bank is earning more from its assets compared to what it is paying on its liabilities. This would lead to an increase in net interest income, as the bank is making more money from the interest rate differential between its assets and liabilities. Therefore, when the spread between interest rates on RSA and RSL increases, the bank's net interest income would be expected to increase.
Hence answer option A) is correct and options B), C), and D) are incorrect.","Interest: Interest is the cost of borrowing money, i.e., the fee paid by a borrower to a lender for the use of money.

Given information:
The mortgage loan amount is $250,000.
The interest rate is 5%.
The payments are done on monthly basis. (So, 12 months is taken as the total months in a year for the calculation of interest payment.)
The duration of the loan is 30 years.
Calculation of the portion of the first month's payment:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm\text{Interest payment}} &= {\rm\text{Loan amount}} \times {\rm\text{Interest rate}} \times \frac{{{\rm\text{First month}}}}{{{\rm\text{Total month in a year}}}}\\ &= \$ 250,000 \times 5\%  \times \frac{1}{{12}}\\ &= \$ 250,000 \times 0.05 \times 0.0833\\ &= \$ 1,042\end{align*}

40,"A $12,000, 5% note is dated May 18 and is due in 90 days. Using a 360-day year, the maturity value would be:","$12,000.","$12,150.","$12,175.","$12,050.",B,"The correct answer is
b. $12,150
.
The maturity value of a note consists of two components:
Face value = $12,000
Interest due on the note (Note 1) = $150
Arranging these components logically gets us to the following number:
Note's maturity value = Face value of the note + Interest on the note
Note's maturity value = $12,000 + $150
Note's maturity value = $12,150
Note 1:
The interest on the note should be calculated at $12,000 @ 5% for 90 days.
Interest on the note = Face value of the note × Interest rate × {eq}\dfrac{90}{360} {/eq}
Interest on the note = $12,000 × 5% × {eq}\dfrac{90}{360} {/eq}
Interest on the note = $150",Notes Payable: Notes payable are an obligation arising from the amount borrowed by the business from the lender against a note. It contains a promise confirming the repayment of the face value and interest on the due date.

option b. $308.76
.
Given information:
Cash price = $690
Down payment = $69
Amount of 24 payments = $38.74
The finance charge can be calculated by deducting the total cash price from the total amount paid:
