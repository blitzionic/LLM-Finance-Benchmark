id,question,A,B,C,D,Answer,Explanation,Hint
1,The forward rate differs from the unbiased expected rate due to the :,default risk premium,term premium,local sales tax,risk-free rate,A,"The correct answer is
a.  default risk premium
.
The unbiased expected rate does not include a default premium risk for changing market conditions meaning no basis exists when anticipating a future price.  A default risk premium serves as protection for risks assumed when entering a long-term agreement.  Unbiased means that no assumptions are being made on potential variances between the predicted and actual outcomes when considering potential future values (e.g., commodity prices, interest rates, etc.).
The unbiased expected rate is based on a predictor that assumes spot prices at a future point  in time will be equal to current forward prices.  Spot prices represent the current cost for product, service, or commodity if purchased or obtained today.  The forward rate is the spot rate adjusted based on a future financial obligation or other cost adjustments.  The forward rate considers risk, and an offsetting premium or interest rate for risks assumed including the potential for default when entering into a long-term (i.e., greater than six months) contractual agreement.
Answer b, c, and d are incorrect.","Expectations Theory: The concept of expectations theory is the prediction of future values based on current information.  More specifically, the expectations theory represents an attempt to forecast long-term values based on short-term information.  For example, investors may use short-term interest rates to predict future rates when evaluating investment options."
2,Which of the following scenarios would cause a speculator to buy low and sell high?,Farmers expect to have a bumper harvest of corn next year.,Imports of corn begin to flood the country.,The government is expected to pass legislation making it mandatory for all vehicles to use corn-based fuels within one year.,The government is expected to subsidize corn production for farmers.,C,"The correct option is c. The government is expected to pass legislation making it mandatory for all vehicles to use corn-based fuels within one year.
When the government passes the legislation making corn-based fuels mandatory for vehicles, the demand for corn-based fuels will increase, increasing the demand for corn. As the demand for corn increases, the price of corn will increase.
Thus, the speculator could buy the corns at a low price today and sell them at the increased price due to the government`s legislation, making profits.
Reasons for incorrect options:
Option a. is incorrect because if farmers have expectations of a bumper harvest of corn in the next year, then the price of corn will not increase next year, making it impossible to sell high.
Option b. is incorrect because if the imports of corn increase, the price decreases, and the corn cannot be sold at a higher price.
Option d. is incorrect because if the corn production is expected to be subsidized, the corn price will not increase, making it impossible for the speculator to sell the corn at high prices.",Speculation The formation of a theory or concept without having any empirical evidence or proof. Speculation in sales and purchase is the expectation-based purchase of a good in the hope that its price will increase in the future.
3,Forward rates are:,quoted in both direct and indirect form.,quoted at a premium or discount.,beneficial to risk-reduction.,all of the above,B,"b. quoted at a premium or discount.
The forward rates are quoted at a premium or discount to the spot rate, points are added or subtracted to the spot rate to arrive at a forward rate. The forward rate is affected by the  prevailing interest rates in the two currencies. It is a rate that will be applied to future transactions when they mature or get to expiration.","Currency Forward A currency forward, is a  forward contract or  an agreement between the buyer and the seller, that allows the buyer to lock in an exchange rate for a transaction that will be executed in the future. This is an over the counter financial instrument."
4,Under which scenario is basis risk likely to exist?,A hedge (which was initially matched to the maturity of the underlying) is lifted before expiration.,The correlation of the underlying and the hedge vehicle is less than one and their volatilities are unequal.,The underlying instrument and the hedge vehicle are dissimilar.,All of the above are correct.,D,"Correct Option:
D .
Explanation for the correct answer:
All the options have the possibilities to create the basis risk as it includes the dissimilar assets, not having perfectly co-related attributes and hedging due to volatility in prices.
Explanations:
Option: A - Because hedging is lifted before the expiration of the maturity period, attached with the security.
Option: B- This options possible as the asset are not identical & not even completely co-related.
Option: C- Basis risk definitely arises when there is hedging between mismatched securities.
Hence, All of the above options are correct.",Basis risk: It is a risk arises when the assets or the instruments under hedging are of not the similar attributes and hence it is imperfectly compared which cannot offset the losses that arises out of such hedging. Potential risk under such hedging increases.
5,Fine Goods Company and Global Sales Corporation enter into a contract that does not specify the payment terms. Payment may be made in:,cash or check only,cash only,cash or any commercially acceptable substitute,none of the above,C,"The correct answer is
c.
If any two parties enter into a contract with each other, and do not specify the terms if ayement, the payment can be made using cash or any other acceptable substitute. The payment shall be made on time and the acceptable means shall be used for it.
The analysis of the incorrect options.
a) There are various other means of making payment instead of just cash and check only. Such measures should be legally and commercially acceptable. The options of payment are not just restricted to cash and check now.
So, it is an incorrect option.
b) if the legally accepted mode of payment is cash only, it really limits the options of the person or party making the payment. It may also cause delay in the payment. So, only cash is not the only means of payment that can be used by ether of the parties of the contract.
So, it is an incorrect answer.
d) The correct answer of the above question is option c, so none of the above cannot be the correct option.
So, it is an incorrect choice.","Contract Contract is an agreement between two or more than two parties which is enforced by the law. All the mentioned parties  have to fulfill the terms mentioned in the contract. If any of the parties fails to fulfill the terms, the other party can file a suit against them."
6,The price of a forward contract on a foreign currency is nondecreasing in its maturity date.,True,False,,,A,"The correct option is a
. Always true.
The price of a forward contract on a foreign currency is determined by the difference between the current spot exchange rate and the forward exchange rate, which is the rate agreed upon for future delivery.
Assuming all else constant, the longer the contract's maturity date, the greater the uncertainty and risk associated with the future exchange rate. Therefore, the higher the forward exchange rate will be to compensate for this risk.","Forward contract: A forward contract is not standardized since it can vary among various trades. This indicates that it can be altered to reflect the traded item, expiration date, and trading volume."
7,"IMXP Corp. enters into a 30-day forward exchange contract to buy 113,540,000 yen for $100,000. Which of the following statements is true concerning this transaction?","IMXP will pay $100,000 today and receive 113,540,000 yen 30 days from now.",The spot exchange rate in 30 days will be 113.54 yen per dollar.,"IMXP will receive 113,540,000 yen today and pay $100,000 30 days from now.","IMXP will pay $100,000 and receive 113,540,000 yen 30 days from now.",D,"Correct optin is""d. IMXP will pay $100,000 and receive 113,540,000 yen 30 days from now.""
Reason- a forward contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset on a specified future date for a specified price","Forward Contract: A Forward contract is a one-to-one, bipartite/tripartite contract, which is to be performed mutually by the contracting parties, in future, at the terms decided upon, on the contract date. In other words, a forward contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset on a specified future date for a specified price. One of the parties to the contract assumes a long position, i.e. agrees to buy the underlying asset while the other assumes a short position, i.e. agrees to sell the asset."
8,Most forward contracts are closed by:,delivery.,offset.,exercise.,default.,D,"Option A is correct
A forward contract can be settled by delivery or cash payment. When the parties enter into a forward contract, both sell or buy assets. The contract can be closed when the contract ends by delivering the asset to the buyer and paying the seller.
Explanations for other options
Option B is wrong because offset means to cancel the liabilities. A forward contract cannot be closed by offsetting the position.
Option C is wrong because exercise means the first step in a contract. It involves the right to buy or sell the asset.
Option D is wrong because, by default, forward contracts cannot be closed. Default means the cancelation of the contract.",Forward contract: Forward contracts are custom-made; the parties in the agreement can make changes as per their needs. Forward contracts are used for speculations and are exchanged through the Over The Counter platform. These types of arrangements help to eliminate risk.
9,a. Why is the value of a futures or forward contract at the time it is purchased equal to zero?,,Contrast this with the value of the corresponding spot commodity?,,,A,"a. The value of a forward contract is equal to zero since no money is paid between parties to the contract. The entire value of a forward contract is paid on the expiry of a contract. Only a valid contract is entered into by parties at the time of purchase.
b. Spot price is used as a basis to decide the future contract price. Parties to the contract take reference from the real world market to determine the price at which parties agree to buy or sell in the future. Hence, the future price is determined using spot price and carrying cost.",Forward contract: A forward contract refers to a contract between two parties where one agrees to buy or sell a commodity or stock on a future date at a price agreed between them. It is a private contract between two parties and terms and conditions are as per the agreement and not governed by any stock exchange.
10,A lawn mower costs $500 in the US and 5188 Mexican Pesos in Mexico. The current exchange rate is 1 USD = 12.97 MXN. At this rate:,The good costs more in the US.,The good costs more in Mexico.,The good costs the same across the two countries.,None of the above.,A,"The correct answer is option
a. The good costs more in the US.
The value of the lawn mower in terms of Mexican Pesos if bought in the US is given by:
{eq}\begin{align*}

&= \text{Value of 1 USD as per the exchange rate} \times \text{Cost of the lawn mower in US dollars} \\[0.3 cm]

&= 12.97 MXN \times $500 \\[0.3 cm]

&= 6,485 MXN

\end{align*}

{/eq}
From the above calculations, it is clear that the cost of the lawn mower is more in the US (
6,485 Mexican Pesos
) than that in Mexico (
5,188 Mexican Pesos
).","Foreign Exchange: In the context of economics, the currencies of different countries are usually traded in the foreign exchange market. The cross-rate between any two currencies is usually derived by considering their standard exchange rate quoted against US dollars."

12,The demand curve for foreign currency slopes downward because as the exchange rate _____ the quantity demanded _____.,"Increases; decreases,","Increases; increases,","Decreases; decreases,",Decreases; stays fixed.,A,"The correct option is
a. Increases; decreases.
Explanation:
Demand for a currency and its exchange rate experience inverse relation that can be defined by the downward sloping curve. Foreign currency curve explains that when exchange rate for a currency increases, it implies that the currency appreciates and its value increases in the market. Due to increase in the value, people from different countries discourage to demand this currency as they have to pay higher money to purchase that currency due to which demand for this currency decreases in the foreign market.","Foreign Exchange Market: A market where people from different nations interact to exchange their currencies to make economic, business, and personal transactions. This market is known as the foreign exchange market and it helps to make economic relations with the rest of the world."
13,Which of the following would tend to shift the supply of Singaporean dollars in the market for the foreign-currency exchange of the open-economy macroeconomic model to the left?,The exchange rate rises.,The exchange rate falls.,The expected rate of return on Singaporean assets rises.,The expected rate of return on Singaporean assets falls.,D,"The correct answer is
D) The expected rate of return on Singaporean assets falls
.
In the market for foreign currency exchange, a leftward shift in the supply curve of Singaporean dollars would mean that fewer Singaporean dollars are supplied at each exchange rate. This could occur if the expected rate of return on Singaporean assets falls.
When the expected rate of return on Singaporean assets falls, investors will be less likely to invest in Singapore, as they can get higher returns on investments in other countries. As a result, there will be less demand for Singaporean dollars, leading to a leftward shift in the supply curve of Singaporean dollars in the market for foreign currency exchange.
Conversely, a rise in the expected rate of return on Singaporean assets would make Singapore more attractive to investors, leading to an increase in demand for Singaporean dollars and a rightward shift in the supply curve.
Changes in the exchange rate (options A and B) do not directly affect the supply of Singaporean dollars, but rather the demand. A rise in the exchange rate would decrease the quantity of Singaporean dollars demanded (shift demand left) while a fall in the exchange rate would increase the quantity of Singaporean dollars demanded (shift demand right).","Supply Curve: In economics, the supply curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity of that good or service that producers are willing and able to supply to the market. The supply curve is typically depicted as a line on a graph, with the price of the good or service on the vertical axis and the quantity supplied on the horizontal axis."
14,A long forward contract and a long futures contract have the same cash flow.,True,False,,,B,"The correct answer is
b. False
Long futures contracts and long forward contracts do not have similar cash flows. In the case of forward contracts, payment is made once at the end of the contract period. On the other hand, forward contracts are settled daily; the losses or profits from a position are computed and settled daily at the close of trading in a stock exchange market.",Forward Contracts and Futures Contracts: Forward contracts are customizable agreements where two parties agree to trade in an asset at a particular future date and price. A long futures contract is a standardized contract involving the trade of an asset at a future date for a set price; these contracts are traded in stock exchanges.

The date set by the parties to begin the period of performance under the contract is referred to as the ""contract effective date."" The effective date may never be earlier than the day the contracting officer or other specified higher approval authority signs it.
The explanation for the wrong options.
Option A: A futures contract is a formal agreement to buy or sell a certain commodity asset, investment, or other financial instruments at a defined price at a predetermined point in the future.
Option C: In the future contract both parties are liable to buy and sell future.

29,The forward market is especially well-suited to offer hedging protection against:,translation risk exposure,transactions risk exposure,political risk exposure,taxation,A,"Correct Answer: b
The forward market is the means for hedging the transaction risk. One reason for the existence of multinational firms in the forward market is transaction exposure. The multinational firm cannot get away from the forward market in the flexible exchange rate scenario. They have to trade in different tools that help them hedge transaction exposure.
An explanation for incorrect options:
Option a: Forward market is not very much suited for translation risk as this risk applies to the balance sheet items. The market is helpful only for monetary items.
Option c: Political risk exposure is not dealt with in the forward market; a firm can manage it through other policies.
Option d: Taxation is not related to the forward market; it depends on the profit and taxation strategies.","Translation: A reconciling activity facilitating the compliance of laws by changing the subsidiary's financial records into its reported currency is the translation.

33,A forward exchange agreement between currencies states the rate of exchange at which a foreign currency will be bought forward or sold forward at a specific date in the future. True or False?,True,False,,,A,"The answer is
True
A forward exchange contract serves the following two purposes:
1. Minimize foreign exchange losses - The exchange rates keep changing dynamically. Hence a forward exchange contract enables the selection of a conversion rate at any future date called Spot Rate. On the future date, that is the date of settlement, irrespective of the prevailing rate of exchange, the transaction is carried out at the agreed spot rate only.
2. Hedging- The forward exchange contracts themselves are traded as an instrument. The lower the spot rate of a contract, the more money a buyer will pay for the said contract.","Contract A contract is an agreement between any two parties.

38,"Pre-harvest, a Basis contract will downward price risk reduce.",True,False,,,B,"The answer is
False
As the commodity prices fluctuate all the year-round. During the pre-harvest period, the farmer or producer of the commodity may want to get into a contract to lock the price for the commodity that is going to be delivered in the future date; based on the future price after taking into account the agreed-upon quality & quantity, and transportation cost estimates. This is done because there is always a fear of the commodity price decrease in the future. The basis is the difference between the cash price and the futures contract price of the commodity in question. The basis contract is a method of forward contracting because it is agreed upon the basis that is fixed, which in turn is related to the specified futures contract price. No doubt that the basis contract is entered with an intention to eliminate the downward price risk. However, if the prices go high during the delivery time, one is still required to honor the contract at the pre-decided negotiable price, which will turn out to be a loss to the farmer. Thus, during the pre-harvest time, there is no guarantee that the basis contract will reduce the downward price risk because there may be chances of the prices going high, leading to losses at the delivery time. So, the statement in the question is false.",Law Of One Price: The Law of one price for commodities theoretically is that the difference in prices for identical commodities from one location to the other shouldn't be greater than the transportation cost and must be sold at equal prices.
