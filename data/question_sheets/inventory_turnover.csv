Explanation:
Inventory turnover is the ratio of cost of sales to average inventories.
Average inventory is the sum of beginning and ending inventory, divided by 2. To compute for the average inventory, we need to compute for the ending inventory first, as follows:
Beginning inventory
$500,000
Add: Purchases
$1,500,000
Less: Cost of sales
$1,200,000
Ending inventory
$800,000
Average inventory can now be computed as follows:
Average inventory = (Beginning inventory + Ending inventory) / 2
Average inventory = ($500,000 + $800,000) / 2
Average inventory = $650,000
Inventory turnover is computed as follows:
Inventory turnover = Cost of sales / Average inventory
Inventory turnover = $1,200,000 / $650,000

48,"With respect to inventory turnover, Traditional Home turns its inventory __________ than the average firm in the industry.",approximately the same as the industry,slower than the industry,faster than the industry,,A,"The correct answer cannot be deduced without an image associated, but the following provides explanations as to when each of the answers would be true.
A) approximately the same as the industry:
Traditional Home would measure approximately equal to the industry if their holding time of inventory is equivalent to their competitors. It is generally preferred to not hold inventory for significant amounts of time as this requires additional holding space and delays profits. Additionally, money tied up in held inventory results in an opportunity cost by preventing those funds from being allocated elsewhere. If the holding time is equal to the industry, this organization can remain viable but may not be an industry leader.
B) slower than the industry:
Turning inventory slower than the industry is typically a bad indicator for an organization. Stale inventory can often result in prices being cut to liquidate. Certain home decor items will be seasonal or consistent with fashion trends. If these items are moving slower than competitors inventory this could result in items being sold at reduced profit margins or even at a loss to clear them out. Additionally, having too much inventory can result in additional storage and holding costs. Finally, if the company is purchasing inventory with debt, this could result in higher interest payments to cover the borrowing costs until the inventory is sold.
C) faster than the industry:
Moving inventory faster than the competition is generally preferred. This means the organization is making faster profits and will have lower costs associated with holding inventory. However, moving inventory too fast could be an indication the company is not buying enough products. If the company has shortages of items due to not purchasing enough, this could result in missed sales. If the company is moving inventory faster than the competition, it should investigated to ensure the reasons are positive and profits are not being missed due to a lack of sufficient inventory.",Inventory Turnover: Inventory turnover measures the amount of time it takes to sell a full stock of products over a given time.
