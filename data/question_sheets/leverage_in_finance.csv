1,The degree of financial leverage is concerned with the relation between?,changes in volume and changes in EPS.,changes in volume and changes in EBIT.,changes in EBIT and changes in EPS.,changes in EBIT and changes in operating income.,C,"The correct option is C. changes in EBIT and changes in EPS
Reason: Financial leverage determines the fluctuation in the earnings per share of the business entity. The above-mentioned option is correct because the financial leverage is determined by using following formula:
{eq}\begin{align*}

\rm\text{Financial leverage}&=\dfrac{\rm\text{Percentage change in EPS}}{\rm\text{Percentage change in EBIT}}

\end{align*}

{/eq}
Explanation for incorrect options: Other options are incorrect because financial leverage does not make comparison between the Change in volume respective to change in EPS and EBIT.",Earnings Before Interest and Tax: The total of the economic benefit that a business entity gained from the operation before making any adjustment in respect of the interest paid and the tax liability is known as earnings before interest and tax. It is used for calculating the financial leverage as well.
2,"A company has an EBIT of $2,400,000 and an interest expense of $300,000. What is its DFL?",8.0,0.125,1.1429,Not enough information to determine the answer.,C,"The correct answer is option c. 1.1429.
Given Information:
EBIT is $2,400,000
Interest expense is $300,000.
The degree of financial leverage can be formulated with the help of the company's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) and the interest expense. The formula for DFL is:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm\text{DFL}} &= \frac{{{\rm\text{EBIT}}}}{{{\rm\text{EBIT}} - {\rm\text{Interest expense}}}}\\ &= \frac{{\$ 2,400,000}}{{\$ 2,400,000 - \$ 300,000}}\\ &= \frac{{\$ 2,400,000}}{{2,100,000}}\\ &= 1.1429\end{align*} {/eq}
Therefore, the DFL is
1.1429.",Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL): The degree of financial leverage depicts the shift in the entity's profitability due to the changes in the operating earnings; it also assesses the debt a firm can take without losing the profits.
3,The link between leverage and margin __________.,is given by (leverage) = (1/margin),None of the provided answers is correct,is given by (leverage) = (margin),depends on whether we are buying on margins or short-selling,A,"The Correct Answer: A - is given by (leverage) = (1/margin)
Explanation:
Option A is correct as required margin helps in increasing the trading power i.e., the leverage.
Here, the given option defines the relationship between the leverage and margin.
For example: Suppose you have margin requirement of 4% then, the leverage ratio will be
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{Leverage}}\; &= \;\frac{1}{{{\rm\text{Margin}}}}\\

&= \frac{1}{{0.04}}\\

&= 25\\

{\rm\text{So, the leverage ratio is}}\;25:1

\end{align*}

{/eq}
Explanation for the wrong answers:
Option B: This option is wrong because the correct answer is given i.e., Option A.
Option C: This option is also wrong as leverage can't be equal to its margin as margin is the rate that helps in reducing the deposit amount and option clearly state that leverage is equal to the 1 divided by the margin which conclude the proportionate amount.
Option D: The option is incorrect because the relationship between leverage and margin is not based on the put-up amount required to determine the leverage.",Leverage: The leverage is the amount of money between what you have in your hands and what you can trade. It is basically utilizing the borrowed capital for making an investment. By using the leverage one can put small amount and could hold the larger trade position.
4,Financial leverage refers to which of the following?,The difference between the rate of return earned on assets (ROI) and the rate of return earned on owners' equity (ROE).,The difference between the rate of return earned on current assets and the rate of return earned on retained earnings.,The leverage a firm obtains from increasing production.,Decreasing fixed costs per unit by increasing production.,A,"Correct Option:
A.
Explanation for the correct answer:
The financial leverage refers to the difference between ROI and ROE because of the balance sheet primary equation Assets = Liabilities + Equity. This can be interpreted as if the debt will be Nil, then Whole assets will equate the Equity, so then ROI and ROI will also become equal.
Hence, on adding debt, financial leverage, there will be difference between ROI and ROE.
Explanation for the incorrect answers:
Option: B.
There has to be total assets for comparison and not only current assets while calculating the financial leverage..
Option: C.
No, it is incorrect as Leverage arises due to addition of debt and the mere production.
Option: D.
No, actually Financial leverage is the inclusion of debt into the capital and does not affect the fixed cost or the production.","Financial Leverage: Financial Leverage is utilizing the debt as a borrowed capital for generating the assets by purchasing and increasing the assets. For the cash flow loan, the value and the goodwill of the company tends to work as the financial leverage to buck up the creditworthiness."
5,"If a country's GDP decreases, but its debt increases during that year, then the country's debt to GDP ratio for the year will _____ in proportion to the magnitude of the changes.",remain the same,increase or decrease,increase,decrease because GDP decreased,C,"The correct option is:
c. increase
Explanation:
It is given that GDP decreases and debt increases, resulting in a high Debt-to-GDP ratio for the year. The higher ratio results from the increased or higher magnitude of the change as a decrease in GDP reduced the value in the denominator, and increased debt will further increase the numerator, which increases it with a higher proportion. Therefore, the country's Debt-to-GDP ratio for the year will increase.","Debt-to -GDP Ratio: In an economy, economists, policymakers, and other people use the ratio of Debt-to-GDP to analyze an economy's ability to pay back the debt that is borrowed by the rest of the world. A high ratio implies less ability of the economy to pay back debt and vice-versa."
6,Which of the following increases financial leverage?,retiring bonds with a stock issue,using retained earnings to retire debt,issuing common stock,none of the above,A,"A. Incorrect. By retiring bonds, the firm reduces its debt, which decreases its financial leverage.
B. Incorrect. See part A.
C. Incorrect. A new issue of common stocks raises the firm's equity capital. Hence, the financial leverage will reduce.","Financial Leverage: Within a firm, financial leverage refers to how the firm funds its assets with equity and debt capital. The firm's leverage can be described by the debt-to-equity ratio."
7,An increase in a firm's financial leverage will:,increase the variability in earnings per shareB. always reduce the operating risk of the firmC. increase the value of the firm in a non-MM worldD. increase the WACC,,,,A,"An increase in a firm's financial leverage will
(A.) increase the variability in earnings per share.
An increase in financial leverage will make shareholders' share earnings more volatile, allowing them to quickly increase with the increase in leverage. Additionally, growth in the economy leads to large swings in profits in the company, thus increasing the variability in earnings per share.
B. Always reduce the firm's operational risk
is wrong because an increase in the financial leverage increases the risks of operating a business. Despite the high returns associated with increased debt, a business may also be exposed to increased losses, increasing the risks.
C. Increase the value of the firm in a non-MM world
is wrong because the increase in the financial leverage results in an increase in the company's value in the MM world. Due to increased risks in the non-MM world, the business value is expected to decrease.
D. Increase the WACC
is wrong because the increase in financial leverage results in decreases in the WACC and an increase in the firm's value.",Financial Leverage: Financial leverage is a technique in which a business uses borrowed money to purchase more assets. Investors make use of financial leverage to increase their levels of returns on the investments undertaken.
10,A high degree of financial leverage:,is sign of astute financial management.,will always reduce the financing cost for the firm.,will increase the valuation of the firm.,may increase the firm's risk and drive down the stock price.,D,"Correct answer is Option d.
A high degree of financial leverage implies high use of debt in capital structure. This can lead to the following:
1. If a firm does not make high profits, it has to pay the fixed interest on debt, irrespective of its profitability and liquidity. Thus, it can increase the risk of the firm.
2. The rise in risk of the firm will lead to increase in the required rate of return on the equity issued by the firm because the shareholders will want to be compensated for the additional risk. This will lower the stock price.
Thus, a high degree of financial leverage may increase the risk and drive down the stock price.
Explanation for incorrect answers:
a. It is incorrect because the issue of debt can prove risky and having a high degree of financial leverage is not a sign of good financial management at all the times.
b. It is incorrect because high degree of financial leverage reduces the financing cost only when the return on investment is higher than the cost of debt.
c. it is incorrect because the value of firm will rise only in case when the return on investment is higher than the cost of debt, leading to greater EPS and thus, higher market valuation through trading on equity.","Degree of Financial Leverage: Degree of financial leverage refers to the extent of the use of fixed sources of funding in the capital structure. The higher the use of debt, the more the degree of financial leverage is. It can be beneficial or risky for a firm."
12,Which of the following is used to measure leverage?,Current ratio.,Ratio of liabilities to stockholders' equity.,Quick ratio.,Accounts receivable turnover.,B,"The correct answer is
b. The ratio of liabilities to stockholders' equity.
Leverage ratios compute the percentage of assets that are financed by debt. The ratio of liabilities to stockholders' equity shows the relationship between the debt and equity of the company and hence is a leverage ratio.
Explanation for incorrect answers
Current ratio and quick ratio are liquidity ratios that measure the business's ability to pay off its short-term obligations.
The accounts receivable turnover is an efficiency ratio that shows how efficiently the business is using its investment in assets.",Ratio Analysis: Ratio analysis is the study of relationships between different line items of financial statements. It is better to compare ratios than absolute figures as it eliminates the impact of the size of the business.
13,Firms that have high operating leverage tend to avoid large fluctuations in profit when sales fluctuate.,True,False,,,B,"Given statement, 'Firms that have high operating leverage tend to avoid large fluctuations in profit when sales fluctuate.' is
False
.
As sales fluctuate, businesses with strong operational leverage frequently see significant changes in profit. This is because operating leverage quantifies how much of a company's costs are fixed instead of variable. A little change in sales can greatly affect earnings when a business has high fixed costs. In contrast, a business with little operating leverage would see very constant profit levels due to its expenses being more erratic and it being able to respond more quickly to variations in sales.",Operating Leverage: The operating leverage of a corporation is determined by dividing its fixed expenses by its overall costs. A company's operating leverage will be larger the higher the proportion of fixed costs it has.
14,The amount of assets per dollar of equity capital is called the:,asset ratio.,equity ratio.,equity multiplier.,asset multiplier.,C,"Correct Answer: Option C) equity multiplier.
Explanation:
The equity multiplier is the ratio of the total assets relative to the total equity. It indicates the amount of assets per dollar of equity capital.
Formula:
Equity multiplier = Total assets / Total equity
Equity multiplier = 1 + Debt-equity ratio",Equity Equity represents the sum of the contributed capital raised by issuing common stock and the retained earnings. Equity also represents the difference between the total assets and total liabilities.
15,The following data were taken from Alvarado Company's balance sheet:,Compute the ratio of liabilities to stockholders' equity.,"Has the creditor's risk increased or decreased from December 31, 2013, to December 31, 2014?",,,A,"a. Liability to equity ratio is calculated by dividing total liabilities with stockholder's equity. Following is the calculation of Liability to equity ratio of Alvarado Company:

3,600,000
0.8
b. Creditor's risk has increased from 31 Dec. 2013 to 31 Dec. 2014. Increase in liability to equity ratio indicates that creditor's are now more exposed to risk because company has more external liability compared to equity in contrast to previous year when the company had less liabilities compared to equity.",Liability to equity ratio: Liability to equity ratio is calculated by dividing total of external liabilities to stockholders' equity. It is a common measure taken into consideration by investors before making any type of investment into company.
16,"Granny's Greens reported Interest expense of $5,700, Income tax expense of $28,000, and Net income of $88,000. Granny's interest coverage ratio is: (Round the final answer to two decimal places.)",0.05,0.06,21.35,20.35,C,"First, we need to calculate earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by adding the interest expense and income tax expense back to the net income:
EBIT = Net income + Interest expense + Income tax expense
EBIT = $88,000 + $5,700 + $28,000
EBIT = $121,700
Now we can calculate the interest coverage ratio:
{eq}\begin{align*} \text{Interest coverage ratio} &=\frac{\text{Earnings before interest and taxes}}{\text{Interest expense}} \\ &=\frac{\$121,700}{\$5,700} \\ &=\text{21.35}\\ \end {align*} {/eq}
Therefore, the interest coverage ratio for Granny's Greens is 21.35. The correct answer is C.","Interest Coverage Ratio: The interest coverage ratio represents the capacity of the company to pay the interest expense out of the earnings for its outstanding debt. The ratio is very important for investors, creditors, or any entity that is looking to make an investment in the company or lend money to the company."
17,"By 2008, new LBO and private-equity transactions were extremely rare. True or false?",True,False,,,A,"The statement is
TRUE
.

18,Clark Company issued bonds with an interest rate of 10%. The company's return on assets is 12%. The company's return on common stockholders' equity would most likely:,Increase,Decrease,Remain unchanged,Cannot be determined,A,"The correct option is A.
The company will increase its expenses with the 10% bond interest but it will also most likely increase its revenue/profits by 12% as the proceeds from the bonds will be used to purchase assets. This is the return the company earns on its assets.
This is a good example of what is meant by financial leverage.","Financial Leverage: Financial leverage is the use of debt, rather than equity, to expand a corporation's operations or purchase new assets. Leverage is considered positive when the return from the investment is higher than the cost of the debt."
19,"a. A firm has a return on common equity of 13.4 percent, a net after-tax borrowing cost of 4.5 percent, and a return of 11.2 percent on net operating assets of $405 million. What is the firm's financial leverage?",,The same firm has a short-term borrowing rate of 4.0 percent after tax and a return on operating assets of 8.5 percent. What is the firm's operating liability leverage?,The firm reported total assets of $715 million. Construct a balance sheet for this firm that distinguishes operating and financial assets and liabilities.,,A,"a.
The firm's financial leverage can be calculated as follows:
Return on Common Equity = Return on Net Operating Assets + (Financial Leverage * (Return on Net Operating Assets - Net After-Tax Borrowing Cost))
13.4% = 11.2% + (Financial Leverage * (11.2% - 4.5%))
13.4% - 11.2% = (Financial Leverage * 6.7%)
Financial Leverage * 6.7% = 2.2%
Financial Leverage = 0.328
b.
The firm's operating liability leverage can be calculated as follows:
Return on Net Operating Assets = Return on Operating Assets + (Operating Liabilities Leverage * (Return on Operating Assets - Short-Term Borrowing Rate))
11.2% = 8.5% + (Operating Liabilities Leverage * (8.5% - 4%))
11.2% - 8.5% = (Operating Liabilities Leverage * 4.5%)
2.7% = (Operating Liabilities Leverage * 4.5%)
Operating Liabilities Leverage = 0.6
c.
To construct a balance sheet for this firm that distinguishes the operating and financial assets and liabilities, let's first perform the following calculations:
Net Operating Assets = Common Stockholders Equity * (1 + Financial Leverage)
405 million = Common Stockholders Equity * (1 + 0.328)
405 million = Common Stockholders Equity * 1.328
Common Stockholders Equity = $305 million
Net Financial Obligation = Net Operating Assets - Common Stockholders Equity
Net Financial Obligation = 405 million - 305 million
Net Financial Obligation = $100 million
Operating Liabilities = Operating Leverage Liabilities * Net Operating Assets
Operating Liabilities = 0.6 * 405 million
Operating Liabilities = $243 million
Operating Assets = Net Operating Assets + Operating Liabilities
Operating Assets = 405 million + 243 million
Operating Assets = $648 million
Financial Assets = Total Assets - Operating Assets
Financial Assets = 715 million - 648 million
Financial Assets = $67 million
Financial Liabilities = Net Financial Obligation + Financial Assets
Financial Liabilities = 100 million + 67 million
Financial Liabilities = $167 million

21,Which of the following is an example of a leverage ratio?,Payout ratio.,Debt-equity ratio.,Quick ratio.,Return on equity.,B,"The correct option is
b. Debt-equity ratio
.
Explanation:
Leverage ratios are financial measures that assess how much debt a firm employs to fund its operations and investments. The debt-to-equity ratio is a financial leverage that compares a company's total liabilities/debt to its total equity. A higher debt-to-equity ratio shows that a corporation depends on debt funding more frequently, which might raise financial risk.

23,Consider a firm with a constant interest coverage ratio (k),0.5,0,1,as high as possible,B,"The correct answer is option
b.
The optimal interest coverage ratio will be a value that maximizes leverage while minimizing the interest coverage ratio. The interest coverage ratio will be minimum at a level of 0. Given, interest paid= k*FCFt. Since k remains unchanged, the value of interest will be zero if t=0. So, at t=0, the interest paid will be zero. The interest coverage ratio will be equal to EBITDA/Interest Expenses. Thus, if interest expense is zero, the interest coverage ratio will also be reduced to 0.","Interest Coverage Ratio Coverage Ratios measure a company's capacity to pay interest on short-term and long-term debt. The Interest Service Coverage Ratio shows if a firm is capable of paying the interest on debt out of its revenue generated before paying tax, interest, and non-cash expenses."
24,"As the company s leverage increases, the ratio of debt-to-equity increases. True or false?",True,False,,,A,"The correct answer to the given question is True.
The financial leverage for a firm is determined by dividing the assets with the total shareholders' equity. Hence if the equity decreases, the company's leverage increases. Since the total capital of a firm is usually made up of debt and equity only, for a given capital, the debt will increase with the decrease in the equity. Thus, the debt-equity ratio increases with the decrease in financial leverage.","Financial Leverage: The financial ratios such as solvency ratios, liquidity ratios, profitability ratios and efficiency ratios are used by analysts and investors for analyzing and comparing the performance of various firms.

28,"All else equal, as a firm increases financial leverage, the beta of the firm's stock will rise.",True,False,,,A,"Answer and Explanation:
The answer is option _ a. True
Beta of Firm's stock: it is volatility of firm's stock due to change in interest rate or systematic risk present in stock investment.
All else equal, as firm increase financial leverage, payment of interest charges increases. This ultimately increases volatility or beta of firm's stock due to increase in financial leverage, there is possibility of low residual profit available or irregular return for stock holder.
Therefore, increase in financial leverage results rise in firm's stock beta.",Financial leverage: In Financing a new assets firms borrow debt capital instead of issuing new stocks. It is because cost of borrowed capital is lower than cost of issue of new equity. Firms earn higher return over their investment in asset and out of actual profit earn pay interest charges.
29,"Everything else equal, an industry with more leverage will have a:",higher return on assets.,higher return on equity.,lower return on equity.,both A & B.,B,"The correct answer is option b.
By using financial leverage, the company will incur a fixed cost associated with the borrowings. This fixed cost would lower the after-tax cost of debt than after-tax cost of equity.
Hence, in this situation, the ROE in case of leverage would always be higher than ROE without leverage. This is so because the project financed with leverage will have lower percent of shareholding than without leverage. Due to this, the after tax profit would give greater ratio on equity, as fixed interest cost would lower the tax effect.",Financial Leverage: Financial leverage is the usage of borrowed capital in financing the project or business. It is an investment strategy that is used to increase the return of an investment as the cost associated with it is lower than the income that is expected to be generated.

31,A firm has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5. What is its equity multiplier?,1,2.5,3,1.5,D,"The correct answer is
option d. 1.5.
Given information:
Debt-to-equity ratio: 0.5
The debt-to-equity ratio is given to be 0.5. This indicates that the company has half a unit of debt for each unit of equity. The total assets of the company can be calculated by adding debt and equity.
Let's assume the total equity to be 1. Therefore, the total debt would be 0.5, and consequently, the total assets would amount to 1.5 (1 + 0.5).
Determine the equity multiplier, as shown below:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Equity multiplier} &=\frac{\text{Total assets}}{\text{Total equity}} \\ &=\frac{\text{Total debt}+\text{Total equity}}{\text{Total equity}} \\ &=\frac{0.5+1}{1} \\ &=\frac{1.5}{1} \\ &=1.5 \end{aligned} {/eq}",Equity Multiplier: The equity multiplier is a financial metric used to determine the extent to which an entity depends on external financing and debt in its operations.

33,_____ leverage is concerned with the relationship between earnings before interest and taxes and earnings per share.,Total.,Financial.,Variable.,Operating.,B,"The correct option is
B. Financial
.
Explanation:
Financial leverage estimates the change in a company's percentage of earnings per share (a company's profitability that considers the effects of interest, taxes, and the number of outstanding shares) for a unit change in its earnings before interest and taxes (a company's profitability before considering the effects of interest and taxes).
The explanation of the incorrect option:

Explanation:
When the flow-to-equity method is used, we use the unlevered cost of equity to discount the free cash flows to equity. The unlevered cost of equity is the overall cost of capital of an unlevered firm that has no cost of debt. Free cash flows are determined by reducing the capital expenditure from the operating cash flow.","Levered Firm: An unlevered firm does not have debt in its capital structure, while a levered firm has debt in its capital structure.

option a. imposed capital requirement on commercial banks.
In the above condition, if the governments want to reduce the excessive leverage with the help of traditional methods, the government will impose the capital requirement on commercial banks. This imposition on commercial banks will reduce the excessive leverage because the banks will not provide more to the businesses, and they have to keep the money with themselves.
