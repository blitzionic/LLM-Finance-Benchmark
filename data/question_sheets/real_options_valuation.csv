1,The value of a put rises as the price of:,a. stock rises.,a call falls.,a stock falls.,a call rises.,C,"The correct answer is
Option c. a stock falls
In a put option, the position becomes favorable to the buyer of the put when the prevailing security price starts falling below the agreed price at which the transaction will take place in the future.
If the price goes up instead of a price drop, then the option buyer will not exercise the provided right and the option value will become zero.
Hence, a fall in the price increases the put value.","Put Option: A put option can be explained as the one in which the buyer of such an option receives a right from the option seller. Under the provided right, the buyer can sell the security to the option seller. The transaction is done at a later point in time but at the price decided during the contract initiation."
2,Why is an American option with a longer time to expiration generally worth more than an otherwise identical option with a shorter time to expiration? (Select the best choice below.),"The American option with the longer time to expiration has all the same rights and privileges as the option with the shorter time to expiration, plus additional rights and privileges.","The American option with the longer time to expiration has all the same rights and privileges as the option with the shorter time to expiration, plus it must be exercised on the expiration date.",The American option with the longer time to expiration has fewer rights and privileges than does the option with the shorter time to expiration.,The stock of the American option with the longer time to expiration will increase more.,A,"The answer is A. If the American option is simply longer than an otherwise identical American option with a shorter time to expiration, then time value of money tells us it is worth more. Both of the options should have the same rights and privileges, but the longer option has additional rights because the buyer has a longer time in which to exercise the option. This gives more time for events to occur that could be favorable to the option holder.","Option Expiration: As options get closer to their expiration date, their values decrease. Therefore, two similar options can have different values based on the closeness of the expiration date. The probability of possible positive events occurring for the option holder increases the farther from the expiration date as well."
