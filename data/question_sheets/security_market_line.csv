is c. A higher return than expected for the level of risk assumed.
SML depicts different combination of risk and return. In other words, it shows the expected return for a certain level of risk.
A stock which lies above the SML has an actual return greater than the expected return for a certain level of risk.",Security Market Line Security market line is a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model(CAPM). The required return is plotted on the vertical axis and the systematic risk(beta) on the horizontal axis.The SML is a straight line which indicates the required return an investor should earn in the market for any level of systematic risk.
2,The slope of the security market line (SML) is _____.,the beta coefficient,the risk-free interest rate,the market risk premium,the required return on the market portfolio,C,"The correct answer is
C. the market risk premium.
The slope of the security market line represents the difference between the risk-free rate and the expected market return. Hence, it refers to the market risk premium. Alternatively, this slope is the reward-to-risk ratio at a specific level of systematic risk.
A. Incorrect. The beta coefficient is presented in the horizon axis of the SML graph. Hence, it is not a measure of the slope.
B. Incorrect. The risk-free rate is fixed on the SML, which is not a slope.
C. Correct.
D. Incorrect. The expected return is presented in the vertical axis of the SML graph.","Security Market Line (SML): The security market line is a graphic demonstration of the relationship between systematic risk and the expected return on a security. Alternatively, the SML can be treated as a presentation of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)."
3,The security market line displays the relationship between expected return and beta.,True,False,,,A,"The correct answer to the given question is option
a. True
.
The security market line displays the relationship between the expected return on a given security and the beta value associated with that security. The beta value indicates the sensitivity of returns generated by a given security to the returns generated by a benchmark market index.","Security Market Line: In the parlance of economics and statistics, the CAPM (Capital asset pricing model) is used to determine the required rate of return or expected return for a security by using various independent variables. The CAPM model can also be represented graphically by means of security market line."
4,Which of the following statements is CORRECT?,"Beta is measured by the slope of the security market line.b. If the risk-free rate rises, then the market risk premium must also rise.c. If a company's beta is halved, then its required return will also be halved.d. The slope of the security market line is equal to the market risk premium.",,,,D,"The statement
(d.)  The equation of the SML is Y = Intercept + Slope * β, where Y is the expected return, the intercept is the risk-free rate, and the slope is the market risk premium
is CORRECT.
a. Beta is measured by the slope of the security market line.
- Incorrect. Beta is on the x-axis. It is not the slope of the line.
b. If the risk-free rate rises, then the market risk premium must also rise.
- Incorrect. The market risk premium is the market return minus the risk free rate.   Everything else the same, an increase in the risk free rate will reduce the market risk premium.
c. If a company's beta is halved, then its required return will also be halved.
- Incorrect. The effect of beta on expected return depends on the slope of the security market line.","Security Market Line: The security market line (SML) is a plot that relates risk (measured by β on thex-axis) and return (measured by expected return on they-axis). Thus, the SML is a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)."
5,Which of the following is correct?,"According to the CAPM (capital asset pricing model), the intercept of the security market line should be equal to zero.","According to the CAPM (capital asset pricing model), the intercept of the security market line should be equal to the expected risk premium on the market portfolio.","According to the CAPM (capital asset pricing model), the intercept of the security market line should be equal to the risk-free rate.","According to the CAPM (capital asset pricing model), the intercept of the security market line should be equal to the expected return on the market portfolio.",C,"Answer
c. According to the CAPM, the intercept of the security market line should be equal to the risk free rate.
EXPLANATION:
According to the CAPM,
{eq}Er = Rf + B(Rm - Rf)

{/eq}
where
Er
is the expected return on a security
Rf
is the risk free rate
B
is beta of security
Rm
is expected return on the market portfolio
The above equation indicates that higher the beta, the higher the expected return and vice versa.
The security market line is obtained by depictiong the CAPM graphically. The horizontal axis (X axis) represents the risk of the security (Beta) and the vertical axis (Y axis) represents the expected return.The security market line shows the expected rate of return at any level of risk.
The
Rf
or risk free rate in the CAPM equation is the intercept and
Rm - Rf
is the slope of the security market line.
In other words, the security market line cuts the Y axis at the risk free rate where beta of the security is equal to zero.","Security Market Line The capital asset pricing model describes the linear relationship between the risk of a security as measured by its beta, and its expected return. The graphic presentation of the CAPM is known as the security market line."
6,Which of the following represents a plot of the relation between expected return and systemic risk?,"The beta coefficient,","The covariance of returns line,","The security market line,",The variance.,C,"Answer
is C The security market line
According to CAPM, the required rate of return on a security can be calculated as follows:
Expected rate of return = Risk free rate + Beta (Market return - risk free rate)
Higher the beta of the security, higher will be the expected return.
This relationship can be plotted on a graph with beta on the horizontal axis and the expected return on the vertical axis. When the CAPM is plotted on a graph, we would get the security market line (SML) which is a straight line.
The SML shows the the required return an investor should earn for any level of systematic risk (beta)",Security Market Line The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) states that a security's expected return is a linear function of its beta ( or systematic risk). The security market line is a graphic presentation of the CAPM
7,Which one of the following statements is correct?,Underpriced security will plot above the security market line.,Any portfolio that is correctly valued will have a beta of 1.0.,A portfolio that contains at least 30 diverse individual securities will have a beta of 1.0.,,A,"A. Correct.
A security that plots above the security market line (SML) has an expected return higher than the one predicted by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).  A higher than expected return means that the current security price is lower than its intrinsic value.  So the security is underpriced.
B. Incorrect.
Any portfolio will have the same reward-to-risk ratio, but not necessarily the same β
C. Incorrect
Such a portfolio is considered well diversified.  Its beta will be the weighted average of the betas of individual stocks.  So the beta of the portfolio cannot be expected to be 1.0.","SML: The security market line is a plot that relates the market risk of securities (measured by β) and their expected return.  The market risk is plotted on the x-axis and the expected return on the y-axis.  As the name suggests, the relationship between risk and return is a line."
8,"What would you recommend to an investor who is considering an investment which, according to its beta, plots below the security market line (SML)?",Invest; return is high relative to risk.,Don't invest; risk is high relative to return.,Invest; stocks revert to the SML over time.,Don't invest; stocks below the SML have too much unique risk.,B,"Option b
is the correct answer.
The SML line represents the expected return in comparison to its risk. One should invest in assets or portfolios that appear above the SML line, as those securities are undervalued and investable. One should avoid investing in assets that are below the SML line as these exhibit higher risk and low returns.
Option a: Assets below SML should be avoided as they exhibit lower returns relative to risk. Hence, option a is wrong.
Option c: It is not necessary that the stock will revert back to SML over time. Hence, option c is wrong.
Option d: Stocks below SML do not represent a unique risk as it just considers the systematic risk of the asset. Hence, option d is wrong.",Security Market Line: The security market line is a graphical representation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. It is used by fund managers and investors to determine whether investing in a certain asset or portfolio will yield an expected return in comparison to its risk.
9,An underpriced security will plot:,on the SML.,below the SML.,above the SML.,either above or below the SML depending on its covariance.,C,"c. above the SML.
An under-priced security  will plot above the SML because it has a higher expected return than the assets on the SML (i.e. correctly priced)",Security Market Line The security market line (SML) is a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) . It is a straight line showing the relationship between the market risk of various assets against the expected return.
10,The statute of limitations for the deduction of a worthless security is five years.,True,False,,,B,"The statement is false that The statute of limitations for the deduction of worthless security is five years.
The correct statement is that The statute of limitations for the deduction of worthless security is seven years. Therefore the taxpayer has time to claim the loss from worthless security is for seven years and not for five years.",worthless security: Worthless security is security such as bonds or stock that have no value in the market. The IRS always helps the taxpayer advising to sell or exchange such securities at the end of the tax year. These securities can be sold out through the public trading system or through private mode.
11,"If the market portfolio is expected to offer returns of 16%, then what can be said about a portfolio expected to return 13%?",It plots above the security market line,Part of the portfolio is invested in treasury bills,The portfolio is not diversified,The portfolio's beta is less than 1.0,D,"If the market portfolio is expected to offer returns of 16%, then what can be said about a portfolio expected to return 13%?
D. The portfolio's beta is less than 1.0
Since the return on the portfolio is less than return on market, hence the beta shall be less than market beta i.e. 1.
A. The portfolio shall plot below the market portfolio on the security market line.
B. This can be true or may not be true.
C. The portfolio may or may not be diversified.","Market return: The market return is the return on a well diversified portfolio invested in all possible financial assets.

12,The Security Market Line (SML) _____.,provides a benchmark for evaluating expected investment return.,leads all investors to invest in the same portfolio of risky assets.,is a graphic representation of the relationship between expected return and beta of the above.,all of the above.,A,"A) is correct.  Different investments have different risk levels.  The SML can be used to determine the required rate of return for each level of risk.
B) is incorrect.  Investors have different risk tolerances, so they prefer different investments.
C) is incorrect.  There is no beta of expected return.  Beta is calculated using individual returns.
D) is incorrect because of B) and C).","Risk and Return: There is a historical relationship between the risk and return of investments.  Several models of this relationship have been proposed, including the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the arbitrage pricing theory (APT)."
13,A stock has a beta of 0.8 and the market risk premium is 9%. The risk-free rate is 3%. What is the rate of return on the stock?,Beta.,The risk-free rate.,Systematic risk,The market risk premium,B,"Question 1
The answer is b).
According to CAPM, the required rate of return is calculated as follows:
required rate of return = risk free rate +  beta * market risk premium
required rate of return = 3% + 0.8 * 9%
required rate of return = 10.2%
Question 2
The answer is d).
The slope of the market security line indicates the increase in return that an investor can get by assuming one more unit of risk. In the CAPM, the expected return is given by:
expected return = risk free rate  + beta * market risk premium
The risk of an asset is described by the beta parameter. Therefore, if the amount of risk increases by 1 unit (i.e., beta increases by 1), then the expected return increases by the amount of the market risk premium. Thus the slope is the market risk premium.","Market Security Line: The market security line is a graphical representation of the trade-off between expected return and risk. The efficient portion of the market security line is upward sloping, implying that higher returns could only be earned by assuming more risks."
14,What is the expected return for an asset with the following probabilities and returns:,11.85%,12.00%,11.45%,12.25%,A,"The answer is a.
The expected return is the average of the returns in different states, weighted by the probability of each state, i.e.,
expected return = 10% *(-20%) + 25%*(-5%) + 30% *(12%) + 25% *24% + 10% * 55%
expected return = 11.85%","Expected Return: The expected return of a risky asset describes the average return the asset is expected to earn over a long period of time. The standard deviation of returns, on the other hand, describes how actual returns differ from the expected return."
15,The required risk premium for any investment is given by the security market line.,True,False,,,A,"The answer is
a. True
.
The security market line (SML) is a line showing the expected return of security as a function of systematic risk (i.e., market risk, un-diversifiable risk). The slope of this line is the risk premium for the analyzed security. The risk premium refers to the return in excess of the risk-free return that an investor gains for holding a risky asset. Therefore, by analyzing the SML, the investor can determine the risk premium corresponding to the given security.",Security Market Line: The security market line (SML) is one of the lines analyzed in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) that is applied to all portfolios and individual securities. The other line of the CAPM - the capital market line applies only to effective portfolios.
16,"In risk-return space, the market portfolio (M) is found at:",the point of tangency with the indifference curve and the capital allocation line,the point of highest reward to variability ratio in the opportunity set,the point of tangency with the efficient frontier and the capital allocation line,the point of highest reward to variability ratio in the indifference curve,C,The correct answer is C. The market portfolio is formed at the point of tangency of the efficient frontier curve and the capital market/allocation line,Market Portfolio: The market portfolio is a proxy portfolio that is assumed to offer an investor optimal risk and return trade-off in the market. It usually assumed to be the most efficient portfolio in the market.
17,"If a security plots below the security market line, then the security:",is underpriced.,is overpriced.,is correctly priced.,has a beta greater than 1.0.,B,"The correct option is b. is overpriced.
Security market line helps the business entity or investors to evaluate and choose those investments or securities that can be included in their portfolio. The returns available from the investment and the prevailing risks are compared for this assessment. Therefore, if the security is plotted below the line in the chart, then it can be concluded that the security is too expensive. It shows that the risks related to this certificate are higher in contrast to the returns.","Securities: The financial instruments that have a value and can be traded by the business entity are described as securities. There are three primary categories of these financial resources, namely equity, derivatives, and debt."
18,A project should be accepted if its return plots below the security market line.,True,False,,,B,"The statement is false. If the return of the project stands below the Security Market Line (SML), it indicates that the investor will not get the anticipated return over the inherent risk, which should reject. At the same time, the returns that mark above the SML represent the high level of potential return from the project against the inherent risk, which must be accepted by the investor.","Investment Investment refers to the spending of money on various assets, which may increase the productivity of an economy. It helps to increase profitability and can save from inflation risk. One can invest in stock, financial security, and bonds."
19,Which one of the following will increase the rate of return for a security assuming the security continues to plot on the security market line?,an increase in the market risk-to-reward ratio.,a decrease in the risk-free rate of return.,a decrease in the security's beta.,an increase in the security's unsystematic level of risk.,A,"The answer is:
a. an increase in the market risk-to-reward ratio
. The most common risk return ratio for market strategists is 1:3. Another way to say this is the investor is looking for a deal that rewards three units of return for one unit of additional risk.
b. a decrease in the risk-free rate of return.
False, this decreases the risk, which decreases the rate of return.
c. a decrease in the security's beta.
False, beta is a measure of risk so a decrease results in a decrease in the rate of return.
d. an increase in the security's unsystematic level of risk.
False, this risk is due to poor portfolio management, not the stock itself.",Security market line (SML): The security market line (SML) is the graphical illustration of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The CAPM provides analysts with expected return based on certain levels of systemic risk.
20,"If a group of securities are each correctly priced, then the reward-to-risk ratio:",of each security is equal to the slope of the security market line.,of each security is equal to the risk-free rate.,for each security must equal 1.0.,for the entire group must equal 1.0.,A,"a. Correct.
The security market line (SML) is a graphical representation of the relationship between β and expected return.  The reward to risk ratio is the slope of the SML.  Every security that conforms to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) has the same reward to risk ratio.
b. Incorrect
The reward to risk ratio is equal to the market risk premium, not the risk free rate.
c. Incorrect.
The slope is equal to the market risk premium, which is usually far less than 1.
d. Incorrect.
The reward to risk ratio of any security or portfolio should be equal to the market risk premium.","Correctly Priced Stocks: Stocks are considered to be correctly priced if their expected return is equal to the expected return predicted by an asset pricing model, such as the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).  If their expected return is different, they are mispriced."

{/eq}
The security market line is a line that has a positive slope. The security market line emerges when the expected return is plotted against the beta. Specifically, the expected return is on the y-axis while the beta is on the x-axis. The gradient or the slope of this curve is interpreted as the risk premium.","Sensitivity to Risks: Some investments or stocks are somehow sensitive, while others are highly sensitive to risks. When a stock is referred to as an aggressive investment or stock, it means that it is sensitive to market risk, unlike the defensive one, which is less sensitive."
22,The security market line (SML) is the graph of:,Expected rate of return on investment vs. variance of returns,Expected rate of return on investment vs. standard deviation of returns,Expected rate of return on investment vs. beta,Expected rate of return on investment vs. average returns,C,"The correct option is C)
.
A typical graph has expected return on the y-axis and beta values on the x-axis. The y-intercept is where the beta of zero, or risk-free rate, is found. The graph's objective is to show the market risk premium's activity or slope. This line visually represents the risk-return tradeoff in financials.
Option A)
is incorrect because the return variance does not play any role in SML.
Option B)
is incorrect because the standard deviation of returns does not play any role in SML.
Option D)
is incorrect because the average return does not play any role in SML.",Security Market Line: A line that is drawn on a graph to reflect the capital of a company is called the securities market line (SML). The SML can assist in determining whether an investment product would provide a good projected return compared to its level of risk.

B. relate the market return and beta to a stock's return.
The security market line (SML) describes the relationship between the expected rate of return on a stock and the market risk (or systematic risk).
Required rate of return = Risk-free rate + (Market return - Risk-free rate) x Beta coefficient

24,"According to the capital asset pricing model, __________.",expected return of stock depends on its unsystematic risk.,"in market equilibrium, all securities will have different security market lines.",underpriced securities lie above the security market line.,overpriced securities lie above the security market line.,C,"The answer is c. underpriced securities lie above the security market line.
Underpriced securities have lower market prices than their intrinsic values.  Because their prices are expected to increase to reflect their true value, their expected returns will be higher than the return predicted by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM):
Expected return of underpriced stocks = CAPM return + Positive price correction due to underpricing
Thus, the expected returns of underpriced stock will be higher than the one of the security market line and they will be above this line.
a. is incorrect because beta measures systematic risk only.
b. is incorrect because all securities should lie on the same line in equilibrium.
d. is incorrect because of c.","SML: The security market line (SML) is a graphical representation of the relationship between risk and return.  If the x-axis of a coordinate system represents the beta of different securities and the y-axis represents expected return, the SML would be an upward sloping line with an intercept equal to the risk-free rate of return."
25,"Suppose that A and B are random variables, each follows a standard normal distribution, and the covariance between A and B is 0.35.",14.47,17.20,9.20,15.10,B,"The answer is b.

Question 2
The answer is b.
A security is dominated by another one if the security has both a lower return and a higher risk. Portfolios on efficient frontier are such that you cannot increase their expected returns without taking on more risk. Therefore, theses portfolios are not dominated.","Efficient Frontier: In the portfolio theory, the efficient frontier is the portion of the available portfolio choices that are efficient from the perspective of risk-return trade off.

Explanation:
Given that beta, {eq}\beta

{/eq}, expected return, {eq}k

{/eq} = 14.8% and the risk-free rate, {eq}r_{f}

{/eq} = 3.6%
The slope of the security market line is the difference market return, {eq}r_{m}

{/eq} and the risk-free rate, {eq}r_{f}

{eq}14.8 = 3.6 + 1.26 (r_{m} - r_{f})

{/eq}
{eq}11.2 = 1.26 (r_{m} - r_{f})

{/eq}
{eq}r_{m} - r_{f} = \displaystyle \frac{11.2}{1.26}

Option c. 6.97%.
Given information:
Beta = 1.32
Expected return = 12.8%
Risk-free rate = 3.6%
Note: The slope of the SML measures how much a market portfolio's expected return differs from the risk-free rate. Hence, it is also referred to as the market risk premium.
Determine the market return using the CAPM method:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Expected}\ \text{return} &=\text{Risk-free}\ \text{rate}+\text{Beta}\times \left( \text{Market}\ \text{return}-\text{Risk-free}\ \text{rate} \right) \\ 12.8\% &=3.6\%+1.32\times \left( \text{Market}\ \text{return}-3.6\% \right) \\ 12.8\% &=3.6\%+1.32\times \text{Market}\ \text{return}-4.75\% \\ \text{Market}\ \text{return} &=\frac{12.8\%-3.6\%+4.75\%}{1.32} \\ \text{Market}\ \text{return} &=10.57\% \end{aligned} {/eq}
Determine the slope of the SML by subtracting the risk-free rate from the market return:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Market}\ \text{risk}\ \text{premium} &=\text{Market}\ \text{return}-\text{Risk-free}\ \text{rate} \\ &=10.57\%-3.6\% \\ &=6.97\% \end{aligned} {/eq}
