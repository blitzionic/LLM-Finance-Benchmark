1,"Alpha Corporation has 1,500 shares of $40 par, 7% cumulative preferred stock, and 2,200 shares of $10 par common stock. Alpha paid $10,000 in cash dividends, including one-year dividends in arrears to preferred stockholders. Common stockholders received is:",$0.00 ,$220.00 ,"$1,600.00 ","$5,800 ",C,"The correct answer is
option C. $1,600.
Given information:
Number of preferred stock= 1,500
Par value =$40
Dividend rate=7%
Number of common stock= 2,200
Par value =$10
Total dividend paid = $10,000
The preferred dividend is computed by multiplying the number of preferred stocks by the par value and dividend rate.
Step 1: Determine the annual preferred dividend as follows:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Annual preferred dividend} &=\text{ Number of preferred stocks }\times \text{ Par value }\times \text{ Dividend rate} \\ &=\text{1,500 }\times \text{ }\!\!\$\!\!\text{ 40 }\times \text{ 7 }\!\!\%\!\!\text{ } \\ &=\$60,000\text{ }\times \text{ }7\% \\ &=\$4,200 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Step 2: Determine the total dividend paid to preferred stockholders in the current year as follows:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Total dividend pai}{{\text{d}}_{\text{preferred stock}}} &=\text{ Current year dividen}{{\text{d}}_{\text{preferred stock}}}\text{ }+\text{ Dividend arrear}{{\text{s}}_{\text{preferred stock}}} \\ &=\$4,200+\text{ }\$4,200 \\ &=\$8,400 \end{aligned} {/eq}
It implies that preferred owners will get annual dividend payments of $4,200. Preferred investors will receive a $8,400 total dividend this year because the one-year dividend is in arrears.
Step 3: Determine the dividend given to common stockholders as follows:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Dividend Paid to common stockholders} &=\text{ Total dividend paid }-\text{ Dividend paid to preferred stockholders} \\ &=\$10,000-\$8,400 \\ &=\$1,600 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Thus, the common stockholders received $1,600.",Preferred Dividends : Preferred dividends are a fixed sum of money that businesses distribute to their preferred stockholders from their profits. Preferred stockholders receive dividend payments prior to common stockholders.
2,Preference shareholders' sacrifice of undeclared preference dividend is to be credited to:,preference share capital.,paid-up capital.,equity capital stock.,none of these.,D,"The correct option is d. none of these.
No shareholder is entitled to dividends. So, it is incorrect to say that undeclared preference dividends are sacrificed. Also, dividends are only recorded when they are declared. So,
undeclared dividends are not recorded in the accounting records
.
Preference shareholders have a preferred right to dividends over common shareholders when they are declared. This right accumulates if the preference shares are cumulative. However, if the board of directors decide never to declare dividends, the preference shareholders will never receive dividends, and they have no claim against the company for the undeclared dividends. So, there is also no accounting entry to record these undeclared dividends.",Dividend Declaration: Dividends become due and payable on the date the board of directors formally declare the dividends. They are recorded in the accounting records on the declaration date because that is when the liability is incurred.
3,"Rhubarb Corporation's outstanding stock is 100 shares of $100, 11% cumulative nonparticipating preferred stock, and 2,000 shares of $12 par value common stock. Rhubarb paid $1,600 in cash dividends during the year. Common stockholders received is:",$0.00 ,$500.00 ,"$2,500.00 ","$1,100.00 ",B,"The correct answer is
B. $500.
Given information:
Number of preferred stock= 100
Par value =$100
Dividend rate=11%
Number of common stock = 2,000
Par value =$12
Total dividend paid = $1,600
Non-participating preference shareholders do not receive a portion of any surplus assets or earnings after a company's liquidation. They receive only the fixed dividend percentage that is mentioned on the stock certificate.
Step 1: Determine the annual cumulative non-participating preferred stock dividend as follows:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Annual preferred dividend} &=\text{ Number of preferred stocks }\times \text{ Par value }\times \text{ Dividend rate} \\ &=\text{100 }\times \text{ }\!\!\$\!\!\text{ 100 }\times \text{ 11 }\!\!\%\!\!\text{ } \\ &=\$10,000\text{ }\times \text{ }11\% \\ &=\$1,100 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Step 2: Determine the dividend distributed to common stockholders as follows:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Dividend Paid to common stockholders} &=\text{ Total dividend paid }-\text{ Dividend paid to preferred stockholders} \\ &=\$1,600-\$1,100 \\ &=\$500 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Thus, the dividend received by common stockholders is $500.","Preferred Stock: Preferred stocks are equity instruments that are issued by a firm to raise funds for expansion and growth. There are mainly four types of preferred stocks: cumulative, non-cumulative, participative, and convertible."
4,Stockholders are eligible for a dividend if they own the stock on the date of:,declarationb. recordc. paymentd. issuance,,,,B,"Stockholders are eligible for a dividend if they own the stock on the date of
(b.) record
.
The record date is the date on which shareholders must be on record to receive a dividend. For example, if dividends are declared on February 1, with the record date on February 14, and the payment date on February 25, the shareholders that are eligible to receive the dividends are all those who hold shares on February 14, even if a shareholder only bought the shares on, say, February 10.
The other options are incorrect because:
(a.) declaration
— The declaration date is when the company incurs the liability to pay the dividends, so it is February 1 in the example above. The board of directors names the record date as part of the dividend declaration, and only shareholders on the record date will receive dividends.
(c.) payment
— The payment date is when cash payments are made to shareholders according to the shares held on the record date (February 25 in our example). The payment date is typically a week or two after the record date to give the company time to process the dividend payments.
(d.) issuance
— The issuance date is when the corporation issues shares for the first time. Shares can subsequently be sold to new shareholders, who will then have the right to receive the dividends.","Cash Dividends: Cash dividends are distributions that a company makes to its shareholders from accumulated profits. Cash dividends can be paid on any class of stock issued and outstanding, but a company does not have an obligation to declare and pay dividends."
5,"When Retained Earnings have a debit balance, a deficit exists.",TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"It is
True
that when retained earnings have a debit balance, a deficit exists.
If retained earnings have a credit balance, they are recorded as a component of the shareholder equity on the liabilities and equity side of the balance sheet. The credit balance of retained earnings indicates that the business has surplus profits after distributing dividends.
However, if retained earnings have a negative balance, they will be recorded as a debit balance in the equity account. For instance, a negative amount occurs when a firm's dividend payments exceed the amount of earnings it has made. It is also known as a deficit or accumulated deficit.
Thus, the given statement is true.",Retained Earnings: The portion of total earnings that is reinvested into the business by a firm instead of making dividend payments is known as retained earnings. It aids in determining whether a firm has sufficient funds to meet its obligations and grow further.

83,"A company declares a cash dividend on its common stock on December 24, Year One, payable to owners of record on January 2, Year Two, with checks to be mailed on January 9, Year Two. Which of the following statements is true?",The owners will record the revenue from this transaction in Year Two but the company will record the effect of the dividend in Year One.,This dividend is recorded by the company as an operating expense on its income statement.,"The company will have a liability on its December 31, Year One balance sheet, and the owners will record a receivable on their December 31, Year One balance sheet.","Both the revenue and the dividend paid will be recorded by the two companies on January 9, Year Two when payment is made.",A,"The correct option is a. The owners will record the revenue from this transaction in Year Two but the company will record the effect of the dividend in Year One.
The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
a. The owners will record the revenue from this transaction in Year Two but the company will record the effect of the dividend in Year One.
This is the correct alternative because the company incurs the liability on the date the dividends are declared. However, the owners earn the dividend on January 2, because that is the record date of the transaction.
b. This dividend is recorded by the company as an operating expense on its income statement.
Dividends are recorded in the statement of stockholders' equity, not on the income statement.
c. The company will have a liability on its December 31, Year One balance sheet, and the owners will record a receivable on their December 31, Year One balance sheet.
The owners cannot record a receivable, because the record date is January 2, so on December 31, it has not yet been established to who the dividends will be paid.
d. Both the revenue and the dividend paid will be recorded by the two companies on January 9, Year Two when payment is made.
No, the company must incur the liability and record the dividend on the date it is declared, not when it is paid.","Cash Dividends: Cash dividends are cash distributions made to shareholders from the profits of a company. Companies have no obligation to pay dividends, but once dividends have been declared by the board of directors, the company incurs the liability to pay them."
84,"A company has current assets of $549,000 and current liabilities of $226,000. The board of directors declares a cash dividend of $183,000.",What is the current ratio after the declaration but before payment?,What is the current ratio after the payment of the dividend?,,,A,"Answer (a)
If the current liabilities of the company are $226,000 and it declares a cash dividend of $183,000. The dividend payable account will be credited by $183,000 and thus current liabilities will increase by $183,000
So, the current ratio will be -
{eq}\begin{align} \text{Current Ratio} &= \dfrac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}\\ &= \dfrac{\$549,000}{\$226,000 + \$183,000}\\ &= \dfrac{\$549,000}{\$409,000}\\ &= \text{1.34 times}\\ \end{align} {/eq}
Answer (b)
After the payment of dividends, the dividend payable account will be zero and the cash account (current assets) will decrease by $183,000
So, the current ratio will be -
{eq}\begin{align} \text{Current Ratio} &= \dfrac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}\\ &= \dfrac{\$549,000 - \$183,000}{\$226,000}\\ &= \dfrac{\$336,000}{\$226,000}\\ &= \text{1.62 times}\\ \end{align} {/eq}",Dividends: Dividends are the distribution of income of the company amount its stockholders. Companies declare dividends as a percentage of the par value of the shares.
85,"A firm has $1,200,000 in paid-in capital, retained earnings of $60,000 (including the current year's earnings), and 25,000 ordinary shares. In the current year, it has $40,000 of earnings available for the ordinary shareholders. Assuming that legal capital includes all paid-up capital and that the value of retained earnings equals the firm's net assets, the most the firm can pay in cash dividends per share to each ordinary shareholder is:",$48 ,$1.60 ,$2.40 ,$4 ,C,"The correct answer is
(c) $2.40
The firm can distribute its retained earnings as dividends to its shareholders.
If the retained earnings of the firm are $60,000 and shares outstanding are 25,000; then the dividend per share that the firm can pay will be
$60,000 / 25,000 = $2.40 per share",Dividends: Dividends are the distribution of earnings by companies to their shareholders. The payment of cash dividends is classified as cash outflow under financing activities of the statement of cash flows.
86,Cash dividends are based on the number of shares:,authorized,issued,outstanding,authorized and issued,C,"The correct answer is
C. outstanding.
The shares issued by a company that is currently held by shareholders are called outstanding shares. Since a cash dividend is the means used by a company to distribute its wealth among shareholders, it is always based on the number of shares outstanding.
The other options are incorrect.
A.
Authorized:
It represents the upper limit on the number of shares that can be issued throughout a company's life. This number can exceed the number of shares outstanding. Thus, cash dividends are not based on this metric.
B.
Issued:
It represents the total number of shares issued by a company and includes the shares held by the shareholders as well as the shares repurchased by the company. The cash dividend is not paid on the shares repurchased. Thus the cash dividend is never based on the number of shares issued.
D.
Authorized and issued:
The cash dividend is based on the number of shares outstanding.","Cash Dividend: A share of profits paid out to shareholders in the form of cash is called a cash dividend. It provides regular income to stockholders. As a result, cash dividend-paying stocks are preferred by investors who need additional income."
87,"Company has 100,000 shares of $10 par value common stock outstanding that was originally issued for $18 per share. In the current year, when the price of this stock increased to $60 per share, the company's board of directors issued a two-for-one stock split. The price of the stock immediately fell to $30 per share. By what amount should the company reduce its Retained Earnings balance as a result of this split?",zero,1 million,3 million,6 million,A,"The correct option is
(a) zero
During a stock split, the balance of retained earnings is not transferred anywhere. A stock split only increases the number of shares outstanding and reduced the par value per share. Even the total capital amount remains the same.
There is no change in the balance of the stockholder's equity due to a stock split.",Stock Split: A stock split refers to the bifurcation of existing stock into further smaller parts. A stock split does not change the total stockholders' equity of the business.
88,"Custer.com's outstanding stock is 100 shares of $100, 6% cumulative nonparticipating preferred stock, and 1,000 shares of $10 par value common stock.

B. $800.
Preferred stockholders will get priority in the distribution of dividends. The annual dividend for preferred stockholders will be
100 shares X $100 X 6% = $600.
As preferred stock dividends of one year are in arrears, the total dividends distributed to preferred stockholders will be
$600 X 2 = $1,200

As a result of this dividend, what reduction was recorded in the reported amount of retained earnings?",zero,300K,600K,900K,D,"The correct option is
(D.) $900K
Stock dividend is also called capitalization of earnings as the balance of retained earnings is transferred to the common stock and additional paid-in capital in excess of the par account. The amount transferred is equal to the market value of the shares issued as dividends.
Here, 30,000 shares were issued as dividends when the market price of the stock was $30 per share. So, the balance to be transferred from retained earnings will be

Reasons why other options are incorrect:
B) deferred tax assets:
False, as deferred tax assets are a type of accounting asset that represents a company's ability to write off a current or future tax liability. It's not money you'd get from investing.
C) depreciation of long-term assets:
False, since depreciation is a technique used in accounting to write off the value of a physical asset over the course of its useful life.
D) gain on the sale of fixed assets:
False because, while it could be an example of income, it is not an example of income earned through the sale of securities","Dividend: When corporate leadership chooses to disperse a portion of profits to stockholders, they do so by paying them a dividend.

229,_____ are promised a fixed periodic dividend that must be paid prior to paying any common stock dividends.,Preferred stockholders.,Common stockholders.,Bondholders.,Creditors.,A,"The correct answer is option A.
Preferred stockholders
The preferred stockholders are given special rights when they purchase the entity's shares. One is getting a fixed periodic dividend before the entity pays the common dividend to the stockholders. It is a right that preferred stockholders will get regular dividend payments from the profits earned, and the company is liable to pay to the common stockholders only after they are paid.
Reasons for incorrect options:
B. The common stockholders are only paid once the company has paid all its obligations and the preferred stockholders. They do not get any preference in getting the profit share first and are paid if the company is left with any profit.
C. Bondholders are typically the company's long-term liability that must be paid as per the terms of payments. They are not paid dividends as they are not the owners of the shares. Bondholders are even paid before the preferred stockholders by the company as it is a liability, and obligations are paid before the preferred and the common stockholders.
D. Creditors have provided the company with the raw materials for which the company has yet to pay. Creditors are considered short-term obligation which generally needs to pay within a small duration of a year. So, creditors are paid for the provided inventory and are not paid any interest or dividend.","Dividend: When a person finds a way to earn money by investing funds in an entity by purchasing its share, which will reward him with the return on the investment, that return in terms of money is known as a dividend."

328,"Assume a company has been in business for several years. Which ""Retained Earnings"" account balance should appear on its Post-Closing Trial Balance?",the Retained Earnings balance at the end of the year,the Retained Earnings balance at the beginning of the year,,,A,"The correct answer is option a. the Retained Earnings balance at the end of the year.
In a post-closing trial balance, the ending balance of retained earnings is the amount reflected on the said trial balance. This balance represents the accumulated earnings of the company after all temporary accounts, such as revenues, expenses, and dividends, have been closed or reset to zero at the end of the accounting period.
The beginning balance of retained earnings for the next accounting period would be the same as the ending balance in the post-closing trial balance. As the next accounting period progresses, this beginning balance will be adjusted based on the results of the business operations. The company's net income (or loss) from the new period will be added to (or subtracted from) the beginning retained earnings balance and any declared dividends, which would reduce the retained earnings.
In summary, the post-closing trial balance reflects the ending balance of retained earnings for a specific accounting period. This balance becomes the beginning balance for the subsequent period, subject to adjustments based on the company's financial performance and dividend declarations.
Accordingly,
the correct answer is option a. the Retained Earnings balance at the end of the year.","Balance Sheet: Typically after an accounting period, such as a month, quarter, or year, a balance sheet provides a comprehensive summary of all permanent account balances for a company."

Reason: Dividends are payments made by a corporation to its shareholders as a distribution of profits. When a corporation declares dividends, it reduces its retained earnings, which is a component of equity. Therefore, when the dividends are paid, the Dividends account is debited to reflect the decrease in equity. This is because debiting an equity account decreases it while crediting an equity account increases it. Thus, option (D) is correct.
Reasons for incorrect options:
Option (A) Dividends are an expense
is incorrect as the expenses are costs incurred in the normal course of business to generate revenue. In contrast, dividends are a distribution of profits to shareholders. Expenses are typically recorded as debits, but dividends are not expenses. Thus, option (A) is not true.
Option (B) Dividends are declared as an asset
is incorrect as the assets are resources owned by a corporation that have value and can be used to generate revenue. Dividends are not assets because they represent a distribution of profits, not a resource owned by the corporation. Thus, option (B) is not true.
Option (C) Dividends do not reduce liabilities

Dividends are not liabilities because they represent a distribution of profits to shareholders, not an obligation owed by the corporation.

b.

This view suggests that investors are risk-averse and value certainty over potential gains that may or may not materialize.
The explanation of incorrect options:
a. The option is inconsistent with the bird-in-hand dividend theory as it suggests that dividend policy has no impact on stock value, which contradicts the bird-in-hand dividend theory. According to the bird-in-hand dividend should increase the value of the firm's common stock. Therefore, the statement is inconsistent with this theory.
c. Option c is inconsistent with the bird-in-hand dividend theory as it suggests that capital gains are preferred by wealthy investors above dividends, which contradicts the theory's assumption that investors prefer certainty over uncertainty.
d. Option d is also inconsistent with the bird-in-hand dividend theory. This is because the theory asserts that compared to capital profits, dividends are more reliable, which goes against the theory's assumption, that dividends are more certain.

a. 550 shares with a market value of $2,000.
Summary:
