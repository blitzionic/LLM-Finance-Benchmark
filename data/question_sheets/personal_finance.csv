This term is not used to refer to the due date of a promissory note.",Promissory Note: A promissory note is a written document wherein one party promises to pay a specified amount to another party on a specified date. A company can issue a secured or unsecured promissory note.
2,The parties involved in a draft or a check have particular names. The person who receives the money is called the:,payee,drawer,holder,payer,A,"The correct answer is option a. payee.
The person who receives the money from a draft or a check is referred to as the ""payee.""
The party who writes the check and provides the funds is referred to as the ""maker"" or ""drawer"" of the check. Additionally, the party who is responsible for the amount of money written on the check is referred to as the ""drawee."" It is important to note that the ""drawee"" is not necessarily the same as the ""maker"" or ""drawer"" of the check; the ""drawee"" is the party that is obligated to pay the ""payee"" the amount of money written on the check.

Character - referring to the credit history of the borrower.
Conditions -  referring to the amount of principal or interest rate
Capacity - refers to the buyer's ability to pay its obligation. It also assesses the debt-to-income ratio of the borrower, thus, it uses the data of how profitable the business is and does it have a good cash flow.
Capital - refers to the borrower's level of seriousness.
Collateral - refers to the assurance lending company can get in times the borrower will not able to pay the amount owed.
Accordingly, capacity measures the borrower's profitability and cash flow to manage operations and growth.","Credit Rating: In business and finance, the individual credit rating is significant when applying for a loan or other related transactions.

9,A stock has a beta of 1.14 and an expected return of 10.5 percent. A risk-free asset currently early is 2.4 percent.,What is the expected return on a portfolio that is equally invested in the two assets?,"If a portfolio of the two assets has a beta of 0.92, what are the portfolio weights?",,,A,"a.
E(rp) = E(r) x stock weight + E(r) x Risk-free asset weight
E(rp) = 10.5% x 0.50 + 2.4% x 0.50
E(rp) = 5.25% + 1.2%
E(rp) = 6.45%
b.
Let the portfolio weight of the stock be x and the risk-free asset be (1-x).
Beta (Asset) = Stock beta x Stock weight + Beta x Risk-free asset weight
0.92 = 1.14 x X + 0 x (1-X)
0.92 = 1.14X + 0
X = 0.92/1.14
X = 0.8070
Therefore, the portfolio weights are
80.7%
and 0.193(1-0.8070), or
19.3%
.",Portfolio Weights: The portfolio weights of the stock are assigned systematically by the portfolio manager to minimize the portfolio risk. Higher-risk assets are given a low weightage while low to medium-risk assets have a high weightage in the portfolio.
10,The measure of risk for a security held in a diversified portfolio is:,Specific risk,Standard deviation of returns,Reinvestment risk,Covariance,D,"The correct answer is option d.
Covariance
A security with a high positive covariance with the portfolio is riskier in a portfolio context because its returns are more closely tied to the portfolio's overall performance. Conversely, a security with a low or negative covariance with the portfolio is not as risky in a portfolio context because its returns are less affected by the portfolio's overall performance.
Reasons for incorrect options:
a
: The specific risk is the risk that is unique to a particular security and cannot be diversified away in a portfolio and is not a way to assess the risk related to the fund held in a diversified portfolio.
b
: It calculates a security's overall risk but ignores the impact of diversification on a portfolio. Therefore, it may overstate a security risk held in a diversified portfolio.
c
: This is the risk that the future earnings from an investment may not be invested again at the identical profit level as the initial amount invested. Hence it is not a measure of the risk of a security held in a portfolio.","Diversified Portfolio: The term diversified portfolio is a group of investments developed to lessen risk and increase revenues by allocating distinct holdings across several asset categories, including shares and obligations."
11,"When making a budget, your goals should be prioritized and ranked.",True,False,,,A,"Part of our personal finances is to know what are our needs and wants, and out of those pre-determined needs and wants are the rankings of our priorities.

12,Harvey loaned $450 to Chase and received a promissory note. Harvey is the:,maker.,drawee.,payee.,debtor.,B,"The correct answer is
b. Drawee.
The individual in whose name a promissory note is prepared is called the drawee. Harvey received the promissory note. Thus, he is the drawee.
The other options are incorrect.
a.
maker:
The individual who promises to pay the borrowed amount on a future date is called the maker of the promissory note. Chase promises to pay $450 to Harvey. Thus, he is the maker or issuer of the promissory note.
c.
payee:
Being the holder of a negotiable instrument, Harvey is free to transfer the note to another party. If it is indeed transferred, the party to whose name the promissory note is transferred and receives the payment would be the payee.
d.
debtor:
Chase borrows money from Harvey. Thus, Chase is the debtor, and Harvey is the creditor.","Promissory Note: A written document representing an unconditional promise to pay a certain sum of money to another party is called a promissory note.

13,"Crystal signed a simple discount promissory note for $75,000. The discount rate is 13.25% and the term of the note is 120 days.","$3,312.50","$71,687.50","$3,267.12","$19,575",B,"The correct answer is option B. $71,687.50
To calculate the proceeds on loan for Crystal, we need to compute the discount amount and then subtract it from the face value of the note. Here's how to do it:
Calculate the discount amount:
{eq}\begin{align} \text{Discount Amount} &= \frac{\text{(Face Value of the Note) * (Discount Rate) *(Term of the Note in Days)}}{\text{360 Days}} \\ &= \frac{(\$75,000) * (0.1325) * (120)}{\text{360 Days}} \\ &= \frac{\$1,192,500}{\text{360 Days}} \\ &= $3,312.50 \end{align} {/eq}
Calculate the proceeds of the loan:
Proceeds on the Loan = Face Value of the Note - Discount Amount
Proceeds on the Loan = $75,000 - $3,312.50
Proceeds on the Loan = $71,687.50
Therefore,
the correct answer is option B. $71,687.50.",Promissory Note: A promissory note is a binding negotiable financial instrument or document in which one party (the issuer or maker) promises to pay a specific sum to another party (the payee) on demand or at a specified future date.

16,The most important investment prerequisites are,adequate income and insurance.,consistency and risk awareness.,adequate insurance and liquidity.,adequate income and savings.,D,"While everyone has different levels of risk tolerance, there are two things every investor should have before getting started: adequate income and savings. You should never invest money that you don't have. Personal finance gurus suggest investing based on income level and age. The younger you are, the longer your time horizon and the more you can afford to invest as a percentage of income. The percentage can vary from 5% to 10% of your net income. While consistency and risk awareness are important, they don't matter if you're investing money you need.","Personal Finance and Investing: One aspect of personal finance is investing in assets.

17,Personal savings equals,gross domestic income - consumption,personal disposable income - consumption,gross domestic product - consumption,personal disposable income -  taxes - consumption,B,"The correct answer is b.
Personal savings equals
(b) personal disposable income - consumption.
Personal disposable income is a term that refers to the amount of money available for use, and saving after taxes have been deducted. On the other hand, consumption is defined as the spending for the purchase of a utility (money needed to cater to individual expenses). Savings is the money available after deducting the expenses from the income received within a given period. Hence, personal savings is calculated by subtracting individual/personal expenses from personal income. The income should be the income generated after the taxes have been deducted (disposable income). Taxes can be defined as the amount of money deducted from a taxpayer's paycheck to be used as revenue for the government.","Personal Savings: Personal saving is a term used to describe the amount of money set aside for future use and investments.

20,a. What are the specific risks associated with retirement saving and planning? Explain in an organized fashion and in needed details.,,"What can we do about the above risks that you just listed? In other words, how can we mitigate the above-listed risks? Explain in an organized fashion and in needed details.",,,A,"a. Risks associated with retirement saving and planning:
Market risk:
The risk of losing money due to fluctuations in the stock market or other financial markets. It can affect investments in stocks, notes, and other instruments.
Inflation risk:
It is the risk of not having enough money to cover future expenses due to the eroding power of inflation. Inflation can dramatically diminish the buying power of retirement money over time, making it harder to maintain the same quality of living.
Longevity risk:
Thanks to advancements in healthcare and medical technology, individuals live further than ever. This means that retirement savings must last longer, which can be challenging for some retirees.
Health care risk:
It is the possibility of paying unforeseen medical expenses in retirement. Retirement health bills can be very expensive; therefore, budgeting for them in advance is crucial.
b. Mitigating retirement planning risks:
Diversify investments:
Investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities can spread your risk and reduce the impact of any one investment on the overall portfolio.
Inflation-protected investments:
Inflation-protected investments, such as Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), can help mitigate inflation risk by providing a guaranteed rate of return that keeps pace with inflation.
Plan for longevity:
To mitigate the risk of outliving your retirement savings, consider delaying retirement, increasing your savings rate, or purchasing a deferred annuity that provides guaranteed income for life.
Evaluate health care costs:
To mitigate health care risk, understand the potential health care costs in retirement and plan accordingly. This may involve purchasing long-term care insurance or setting aside funds for health care expenses.","Retirement planning: Establishing objectives for income and taking the actions necessary to get there is the retirement planning process, and it involves preparing financially for living when their employment period finishes."
21,7. The capital allocation line is also the_.,investment opportunity set formed with a risky asset and a risk-free asset,investment opportunity set formed with two risky assets,line on which lie all portfolios that offer the same utility to a particular investor,line on which lie all portfolios with the same expected rate of return and different,A,"The correct answer is
A) a set of investment opportunities formed with a risky asset and a risk-free asset
.
A graphical depiction of the investment opportunity set made up of a risky asset and a risk-free asset is known as the capital allocation line. It displays the combinations of risky and risk-free assets that can provide the best-anticipated yield for a specific level of risk (standard deviation). The slope of the capital allocation line depicts the additional return known as the total risk premium, which the investors demand for taking on additional risk.
The explanation of the incorrect options is as follows:
B) The capital allocation line does not comprise two risky assets. The investment opportunity set made up of a risky asset and a risk-free asset is particularly represented by the capital allocation line. The capital allocation line displays the efficient frontier, which is the collection of assets, and when combined, it provides the greatest anticipated return for a particular degree of risk.
C) The portfolios represented by the capital allocation line do not serve the same utility for a given investor. A measure of an investor's individual choice or satisfaction with various degrees of risk and yield is called utility. The capital allocation line, which does not account for the preferences of individual investors, is a graphical depiction of the risk-return tradeoff for portfolios that include both risky and risk-free assets.
D) The capital allocation line that depicts the efficient frontier, which is the collection of portfolios, merges risky and risk-free assets and offers the highest expected return for a given amount of risk. The capital distribution line shows the ideal mix of portfolios with various expected returns and a standard deviation to gain the appropriate risk-return tradeoff.","Portfolio: A portfolio is a combination of financial assets, stocks, securities, or investments that a person, group, or a company owns. A portfolio is created for achieving specific financial goals or objectives. The primary goal of a portfolio is to optimize the trade-off between risk and return by spreading assets across various sectors, regions, and asset classes to minimize risk and possibly increase returns."
22,Decedents in community property states who leave all their assets to their spouses usually owe more estate taxes than decedents in common law states who leave all their property to their spouses.,True,False,,,A,"The given statement is true.
The decedents who leave their assets to their spouses under the community property states owe more estate taxes because they cannot be owned separately. The property is exposed to creditors and liabilities of both spouses, which increases the estate taxes. On the other hand, the decedents under common law state who leave their property to their spouses owe fewer taxes because the assets are owned separately. The spouses can own property differently from their spouses, hence fewer estate taxes.","Estate Tax: Estate tax refers to the financial levy imposed on an estate and is subject to the assets' current net worth. The Federal estate tax postulates that taxes are charged on more than $11.4 million in asset worth as per the 2019 law, but one among four states possesses their estate tax with lower bounds. Spouses who inherit assets are exempted from the estate tax, while the recipients of a certain estate's assets are subjected to inheritance tax for net worth above certain ceilings."

B. can reduce but not eliminate
.
For a portfolio, the diversification process involves having investments in different asset classes like bonds and equities. Furthermore, in each asset class, securities of different sectors and different firms within the same sector are considered.
The total risk of a diversified portfolio cannot be eliminated. It can be bifurcated into systematic risk and unsystematic risk. Systematic risk is a market-wide risk that affects all the securities and cannot be eliminated while unsystematic risk is a firm-specific risk that can be reduced by diversification.",Portfolio: An investment portfolio is usually constructed by complying with the diversification principle. The objective behind a diversified portfolio is to maximize returns without taking incremental risks.

A graphical depiction of the investment opportunity set made up of a risky asset and a risk-free asset is known as the capital allocation line. It displays the combinations of risky and risk-free assets that can provide the best-anticipated yield for a specific level of risk (standard deviation). The slope of the capital allocation line depicts the additional return known as the total risk premium, which the investors demand for taking on additional risk.
The explanation of the incorrect options is as follows:
B) The capital allocation line does not comprise two risky assets. The investment opportunity set made up of a risky asset and a risk-free asset is particularly represented by the capital allocation line. The capital allocation line displays the efficient frontier, which is the collection of assets, and when combined, it provides the greatest anticipated return for a particular degree of risk.
C) The portfolios represented by the capital allocation line do not serve the same utility for a given investor. A measure of an investor's individual choice or satisfaction with various degrees of risk and yield is called utility. The capital allocation line, which does not account for the preferences of individual investors, is a graphical depiction of the risk-return tradeoff for portfolios that include both risky and risk-free assets.
D) The capital allocation line that depicts the efficient frontier, which is the collection of portfolios, merges risky and risk-free assets and offers the highest expected return for a given amount of risk.

From the above calculation, it is concluded that
August 7 will be the due date
as the total days up to July is 113, and the note's duration is 120 days. So, August 7 (120-113) will be the due date.

50,A firm is more likely to offer low starting pay but large pension benefits if:,workers in the firm must possess large investments in firm-specific training.,workers in the firm must possess large investments in general training.,workers can be easily replaced.,None of the above is correct.,A,"The correct answer is
A. workers in the firm must possess large investments in firm-specific training.
A firm will often offer lower starting salaries to employees when they require in-depth, expensive training. Training new employees will require a great number of resources and the organization will not seek to pay high salaries if the individual does not complete their training. Additionally, these employees will have low starting human capital values for the organization. Once individuals receive their training, they will have higher human capital values and the firm will need to entice them to stay. Pension plans offer compensation paid only after an individual retires after a certain term of service to an organization. Pension plans are useful tools to maintain employees within the organization for longer periods of time since they will not receive a pension if they do not meet minimum service requirements. The airline industry and the military are two main groups that use pension systems to retain talent. Pension systems are often better retention tools than simply offering higher pay since individuals cannot reap short-term benefits while later being enticed to higher-paying competitors before reaching the desired time of service for return on investment by the organization.",Pension System: A pension system is a retirement benefit that is often characterized as having a defined benefit. Employees who meet service requirements within an organization will receive continued compensation after retirement. Most pensions will pay benefits as long as the individual remains alive and some may be passed on to spouses or dependents with certain restrictions. In the 1970s new legislation created defined contribution systems such as the 401k which with time have replaced the majority of pension plans.

d. Company A 18.53 percent, Company B 65.04 percent, Company C 16.43 percent

Given Data:
Shares of company A = 500 shares
Stock price of company A = $19.25
Shares of company B = 800 shares
Stock price of company B = $42.22
Shares of company C = 300 shares
Stock price of company C = $28.44
The portfolio weight is computed by dividing each stock's market value/market capitalization by the individual's total market value. The obtained fraction is multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage portfolio weight.
The market value of each stock illustrates the product of stock price and shares. That is,
{eq}\rm Market\,value = Share \times Stock\,price {/eq}
Therefore, the market value of companies A, B, and C are computed as:

Then, the portfolio weight is computed as follows:
Company A
The portfolio weight of company A is:
{eq}\begin{align*} \rm Portfolio\,weight &= \rm \dfrac{{Market\,value\,of\,A}}{{Total\,market\,value}} \times 100\\ &= \rm \dfrac{{9625}}{{51933}} \times 100\\ &= \rm 18.53\% \end{align*} {/eq}
Company B
The portfolio weight of company B is:
{eq}\begin{align*} \rm Portfolio\,weight &= \rm \dfrac{{Market\,value\,of\,B}}{{Total\,market\,value}} \times 100\\ &= \rm \dfrac{{33776}}{{51933}} \times 100\\ &= \rm 65.04\% \end{align*} {/eq}
