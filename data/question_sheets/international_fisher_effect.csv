1,"If a foreign county experiences a hyperinflation, _____.",its currency will depreciate against stable currencies.,its currency may appreciate against stable currencies.,its currency may be unaffected it's difficult to say.,none of the above,A,"The correct answer is
A. its currency will depreciate against stable currencies
.
Inflation directly affects currency exchange rates.  Higher inflation reduces the value of the home currency.  This relationship is known as the International Fisher Effect.  If it did not exist, countries could print as much money of the local currency as they wish and then exchange it, for example, for dollars or euros.
B is incorrect.  Hyperinflation is an extremely high form of inflation, and it considerably reduces the value of the local currency.
C is incorrect. The only scenario in which the currency will be unaffected is global hyperinflation that affects all countries.  The question, however, specifies that other currencies are stable.
D is incorrect because of A.",Hyperinflation: Most governments in the world aim at maintaining certain small inflation in their economy.  Hyperinflation occurs when inflation spirals out of control.  This can have devastating consequences on the economy.
2,"As the interest rate rises, debt service:",decreases.,does not change but debt increases.,increases.,does not change and neither does the debt.,A,"The correct answer is A.
As the interest rate rises, debt service
decreases.
High interest rates tend to increase borrowing costs, making it tedious for investors and individuals to borrow money. Therefore, when borrowers cannot borrow money, spending lessens hence low tax revenues and fewer job opportunities due to a decline in investments. Eventually, a rise in interest rates does not stimulate the economy due to low revenues hence a downswing in debt service.
In contrast, low interest rates make it easy for borrowers to borrow funds from lenders due to low borrowing costs. Therefore, through the access to funds via loans, individuals can invest and aid in the stimulation of the economy hence increased debt service.","Interest Rates: Interest rate describes the extra amount that a borrower adds on top of the principal amount they borrow. Interest is paid periodically over an agreed timeframe and is determined by a percentage of the overall principal amount. Additionally, interest can also define the amount a depositor earns upon depositing funds in a financial institution."
3,The interest parity condition is the proposition that,investors' expectations of future changes in exchange rates reflect differences in interest rate policies pursued by the central banks in different countries.,differences in interest rates on similar bonds in different countries reflect investors' expectations of future movements in relative price levels.,differences in interest rates on similar bonds in different countries reflect investors' expectations of future changes in exchange rates.,differences in interest rates on different bonds within a country reflect investors' expectations of future changes in the tax treatment of interest earnings.,A,"The answer is A).
First of all, interest rate parity is based on risk-free rates, which are set by central banks in different countries. Second, the parity argues that expected return from investing in risk-free rates should be the same across countries, when expressing in a common currency. Specifically,
1 + domestic interest rate = (1 + foreign interest rate )  * spot exchange rate / expected forward exchange rate
The above equation could be written as
change in forward exchange rate - change in spot exchange rate = foreign exchange rate - domestic interest rate
Thus, changes in exchange rates reflect different in interest rates.","Interest Rate Parity: In the long run, exchange rate is determined by the forces of demand and supply for currencies for international trade. In the short-run, interest rate parity is one of the models for exchange rate determination."
4,"Assume that interest rate parity holds and that 90-day risk-free securities yield 5 percent in the United States and 5.3 percent in Germany. In the spot market, 1 euro equals $0.80 dollar.",Is the 90-day forward rate trading at a premium or discount relative to the spot rate?,What is the 90-day forward rate?,,,A,"Given information:
Euro spot rate S = $0.8/ Euro
Germany interest rate {eq}R_{EUR}

{/eq}= 5.3% (assumed annual interest rate)
U.S. interest rate  {eq}R_{USD}

Since the 90-day forward rate is not provided we cannot compare it with the theoretical forward rate calculated above.
Sub part b: What is the 90-day forward rate?
The 90-day forward rate is $0.7994/Euro",Forward Exchange Rates: Forward exchange contracts are an obligation to exchange one currency into another at a fixed rate within a fixed period. The forward exchange rate is a function of interest rates of the two countries involved to maintain the interest rate parity.
5,"When Interest Rate Parity (IRP) does not hold, _____.",there is usually a high degree of inflation in at least one country.,the financial markets are in equilibrium.,there are opportunities for covered interest arbitrage.,both b) and c),A,"A. is incorrect.  Interest rate parity (IRP) does not require the existence or lack of inflation in any country.
B. is incorrect.  If markets are in equilibrium, IRP will hold and there will be no arbitrage opportunities.
C. is correct.
If IRP does not hold, an investor can earn a higher return by investing in a foreign country and converting the proceeds back to his/her home currency.  This investor can borrow funds at home and invest abroad, thus earning a risk-free profit.
D. is incorrect because of B.","Covered Interest Arbitrage: Covered Interest Arbitrage is an investment activity, in which investors borrow funds in one country to invest in another country.  The arbitrage also involves fixing the future exchange rate by entering into a forward contract."
6,Calculate the real interest rate if the nominal rate is 9.5% and the inflation rate is 3.9%. Hint: Base your answer on the Fisher Effect.,5.51%,5.89%,5.39%,,C,"The real rate of return based on the Fisher Effect is c. 5.39%
The Fisher relationship can be represented as:
(1 + Nominal Rate) = (1 + Real Rate) * (1 + Inflation)
Given in the question:
Nominal Rate
= 9.50% or 0.095
Inflation
= 3.9% or 0.039
Substituting the values in the formula, we get
(1 + 0.095) = (1 + Real Rate) * (1.039)
(1 + Real Rate) = (1 + 0.095) / (1.039)
(1 + Real Rate) = 1.05389797883

7,The 1-year risk-free interest rate in Mexico is 10%. The 1-year risk-free interest rate in the USA is 2%. Assume that interest rate parity exists. The spot rate of the Mexican peso is $0.14.,What is the forward rate premium?,What is the 1-year forward rate for the peso?,,,A,"Given information:
Annual US interest rate = {eq}R_{USD}{/eq}= 2%
Annual Mexican  interest rate = {eq}R_{Peso}{/eq}= 10%
Time to maturity = 1 year
Solution:
Sub part a:
Forward price formula:
Forward price F= {eq}\displaystyle S* e^{( R_{USD} - R_{Peso}  ) *t}

{/eq}
Forward premium/discount is equal to F/S -1 and is given by the formula:
Forward premium/discount = {eq}\displaystyle  \frac {F}{S} -1  = e^{( R_{USD} - R_{Peso}  ) *t} - 1

{/eq}
Substitute the given values :
Forward premium/discount = {eq}\displaystyle  e^{( 2\% - 10\%  ) * 1} - 1

{/eq} = -0.076883654= -7.6884%
Since the value is negative, forward rate is trading at a discount.
Answer: The forward rate discount of the Peso is  7.6884% (since we used the word discount we removed the negative sign)
Sub part b:
We will use the forward price formula to calculate the forward price.
Forward price F= {eq}\displaystyle S* e^{( R_{USD} - R_{Peso}  ) *t}

{/eq}
Substitue S = $0.14/Peso in the formula:
Forward price F= {eq}\displaystyle 0.14* e^{( 2\%- 10\%  ) *1} = $0.1292/ Peso

{/eq}
Answer: The the one-year forward rate for the Peso is $0.1292/ Peso",Forward Exchange Rates: Forward exchange rates are predetermined rates after a predetermined period in the future. These rates are dependent upon the current spot rates and the interest rates between the two countries.
8,An increase in the interest rate in the United States but not in the European Monetary Union (EMU) will lead to:,a dollar depreciation,a dollar appreciation,the dollar/euro exchange rate to remain unchanged,any of the above,A,"The answer is  A).
According to the interest rate parity, a country with an increase in interest rate will see its currency depreciate. Thus, if interest rate in the United States increases, U.S. dollars will depreciate against the Euro.",Interest Rate Parity: Interest rate parity is an equilibrium condition for exchange rates between two currencies. The two versions of interest rate parity are covered interest rate parity and uncovered interest rate parity.
9,Assume that the one-year U.S. Treasury bond rate is 3% and the similar European government bond rate is 5%.,"Comparing these inflation rates, could it be expected that the dollar will appreciate or depreciate against the euro over the next year? Explain.","In addition, if the spot rate is 1.50 dollars per euro, what would be the forward rate?",,,A,"a) The dollar is expected to appreciate against the euro next year. According to the interest rate parity, a country with a lower interest rate is expected to see its currency appreciate. Interest rate is lower in the U.S. compared to Europe, so dollars are expected to appreciate.
b) According to the interest rate parity, we have:
(1 + 5%) * 1.5  / forward rate = (1 + 3%)
forward rate = 1.53
That is, the forward rate will be 1 euro = $1.53","Interest Rate Parity: Interest rate parity is an equilibrium condition for the international money market. Depending on whether forward contracts are involved, the parity could be covered or uncovered."

11,When is a Fisher equation a good approximation of the real interest rate?,when the real interest rate is low,none of the other answers,when the nominal interest rate is low,when inflation is low,B,"The appropriate answer is
b. none of the other answers
.
None of the provided alternatives are correct. From the Fisher equation, the nominal rate is the interest rates and inflation's sum. However, the Fisher hypothesis, also known as the Fisher effect, indicates that the monetary base, which is the amount of money in circulation, has no impact on the real interest rates.
The Fisher hypothesis is forward-looking; it assumes that if a commercial bank offers a 6% interest rate in two years and during this time, a 4% inflation is realized, the real interest was always 2% all along. The conclusion is from the assumption that the shifts in monetary measures and that the money's quantity theory is actual and predictable. Therefore, from the Fisher hypothesis, the nominal rate is the given real interest rate that indicates the money growth cumulated over time to an amount of money owed by an investor.","Fisher Equation: The Fisher equation is an economic concept that illustrates the connection between the nominal rates and the real interest rates in inflation. The nominal interest rate is equivalent to the inflation and the equation's actual interest rates' sum. Usually, the concept is applied when lenders or investors request an extra reward for losses' compensation because of high inflation."
12,When yield curves are flat:,"long-term interest rates are above short-term interest rates,","medium-term interest rates are above both short-term and long-term interest rates,","short-term interest rates are about the same as long-term interest rates,",short-term interest rates are above long-term interest rates.,C,"The correct answer is
c. short-term interest rates are about the same as long-term interest rates.
This is because the yield curve, by definition, reflects the various interest rates for different maturities (e.g. 3 months, 1 year, 10 years, 30 years, etc.) and is meant to show the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates. If it is flat, it means that short-term interest rates are more or less equal to the long-term interest rates.","Interest Rate: When discussing the yield curve of a country, it is important to understand the implication of short and long-term interest rates. The interest rate reflects the annual return for a government bond (in the case of a yield curve) which varies based on liquidity, risk, and maturity."

According to the covered interest rate parity, we have:
1 + domestic interest rate = (1 + foreign interest rate) * spot exchange rate / forward exchange rate
According to the parity, a country's currency is trading at a discount in the spot market if domestic interest rate is lower than the foreign interest rate. In this question, the interest rate is lower in the U.K, so the pound is trading at a discount.",Interest Rate Parity: Interest rate parity is a non-arbitrage condition relating interest rates to exchange rates. The uncovered version of the parity does not involve the use of forward contracts.

To see how it works, consider the following example.  Suppose that Japanese investors can earn 1% on risk free government securities, while US investors can earn 5% on Treasury bonds.  This leads to an influx of Japanese investors into the U.S. market.  Initially they purchase some U.S. dollars.  When they receive their payout, however, they sell 5% more U.S. dollars than they originally bought.  This leads to a downward pressure on the value of the dollar.  Due to the depreciation of the dollar, after converting the dollars back to Japanese yen, the return of Japanese investors should still be equal to 1%.
The correct answer is D.
Both A and C are correct.
A is correct because IRP only holds if arbitrageurs can take advantage of interest rate imbalances.  If investors can earn a higher return in a foreign country, but cannot take advantage of this opportunity due to transaction costs, IRP may not hold precisely.
B is incorrect because investors have access to the same information.
C is correct because artificial limits on the movement of capital may prevent arbitrageurs from operating in some countries, which may cause IRP to fail.","Interest Rate Parity: Interest rate parity is a condition in Economics, which states that an investor can receive the same return by investing in his/her home country as the return he/she can expect in other countries.

27,The annual interest rate imposed as a result of underpayment is:,long-term rate plus three percentage points,short-term rate plus four percentage points,compounded monthly,compounded daily,D,"The correct option is (d)
.
As a result of underpayment, a company is required to impose the annual interest rate which must be compounded daily for the purpose of producing higher returns. As the number of compounding periods increases, it will show an increase in the annual effective rate of interest. Compounding daily would produce higher returns than compounding monthly. And in this manner, underpayment would be covered by daily compounding the annual rate of interest.
Hence, it is the correct option.","Accounting Tool An interest rate would be considered as an expense of a person or a company that has borrowed a loan from another party.

Investors can get a higher return on domestic investments as this economy provides a higher interest rate than the world rates. This would cause the capital account under the BOP to face a surplus as more and more investors increase their capital flows into the domestic economy. This also causes the domestic currency to appreciate in contrast with the other world currencies and command more foreign goods. This would increase the import demand by domestic consumers. At the same time, the exports of this economy would become relatively expensive for foreign consumers, causing a fall in their demand. This causes the current account of the BOP to experience a deficit state.
Reasons for incorrect options:
Option a. is incorrect because due to a higher domestic interest rate, the economy will experience a surplus in the capital account and a deficit in the current account.

What is the Covered rate of return from USA point of view?",3.88%,1.73%,2.46%,5%,D,"Covered arbitrage involves making an investment in another currency and fixing the forward exchange rate, which will be used to convert the proceeds from the investment back to the home currency.  The U.S. investor starts with a $200,000 investment and converts that into Pesos:
Investment in Pesos = Investment in USD / Spot exchange rate
Investment in Pesos = 200,000 / 1.5
Investment in Pesos = 133,333 Pesos
This amount is invested to earn a 9% return in Mexico:
Proceeds in Pesos = Investment in Pesos * (1 + Mexican interest rate)
Proceeds in Pesos = 133,333 * (1 + 0.09)
Proceeds in Pesos = 145,333 Pesos
The final step for the investor is to convert the proceeds back to USD:
Proceeds in USD = Proceeds in Pesos * Forward exchange rate

Real interest rate parity refers to a circumstance where both uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity are true, revealing an association among real interest rates, where differences in anticipated real interest rates indicate variations in the actual exchange rate. The parity state hints that real interest rates will be equal amongst nations and capital movement will lead to capital flows that remove arbitrage chances. On the other hand, the real interest rate refers to an adjusted interest that eliminates inflation's effects to depict the actual cost of assets to a borrower and the actual produce to an investor or the creditor. Therefore, despite the currency differences between various nations, real interest rates are equal.","Interest Rate Parity.: Interest rate parity refers to a no-arbitrage circumstance representing a balance where stockholders will be unconcerned about the interest rates accessible on bank deposits within two or more nations.
