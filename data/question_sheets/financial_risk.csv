Still, from the general public's viewpoint, investment is buying financial assets.
_(B)_If the firm's investment made today gives less return in the future as it has a low expected future return, then it affects the firm's profit, and the amount of economic investment made today will have losses and, in future,the investments will come down. Still, sometimes firms have high confidence to invest in a low expected future return, and it turns out to be profitable as the actual return may rise or fall.
_(C)_If the firm's expected  future returns  are very high, then it can fetch a good profit  in the future and would invest more. But while investing, the firm also needs to check its risk. A higher expected return with lower risk is always preferred.","Investment Investment is a flow of money added to a stock of capital that gives a higher future return.

20,"To convince investors to accept greater volatility, you must:",decrease the risk-free rate,decrease the real return,increase the risk-free rate,increase the risk premium,D,"The correct answer is e. increase the risk premium
Option d. is correct because increasing the risk premium will convince investors to accept greater volatility. An increased risk premium will result in a higher rate of return and, therefore, will increase the overall value of the investor's investment. A higher risk premium will persuade investors that greater volatility may be worth the potential high rate of return.
Option a. is incorrect because decreasing the risk-free rate will result in a lower rate of return. This will not entice investors to accept greater volatility because their investment has a high risk of losing value.
Option b. is incorrect because decreasing the real return will not convince investors to accept greater volatility. Investors in this situation need to be offered a high rate of return in order to be persuaded to invest in high volatility investment vehicles.
Option c. is incorrect because the greater volatility does not comprise a risk-free rate. Conversely, investing in greater volatility means a higher risk investment.",Risk: All investments vehicles are subject to risk.

When the gap between paid and earned interest widens, profit rises. In financial accounting, asset and liability management, or ALM, is the process of controlling the financial risks brought on by discrepancies between assets and liabilities.
After risk management comes strategic planning, this includes maximizing assets to pay for complex liabilities, which might increase profitability, and is more focused on lowering long-term risks than short-term ones.

23,A graph of the relationship between financial risk and expected financial reward would show a curve that has a:,positive slope,negative slope,U-shape,bell-shape,A,"Option a. positive slope
is correct.
It is because the expected financial reward and the expected financial risk are directly related to each other. The dependent variable (financial reward) has a direct relationship with the independent variable (financial risk). This means that with the movement of the independent variable in any direction, there will be movement of the dependent variable in the same direction. If the risk increases, the reward will increase as well to compensate for the extra risk taken.
The other options are incorrect.
Option b.
negative slope
: It is incorrect because the negative slope depicts the inverse relationship, which is not the case in the given variables. The inverse relationship exists between variables when the dependent variable moves in the opposite direction of the movement of the independent variable. Risk and return do not have this type of relationship.
Option c.
U-shape
: It is incorrect because there is a heterogeneous movement in the dependent and independent variables with respect to each other.
Option d.
Bell-shape
: It is incorrect because in a bell-shaped slope, the changes in the dependent variable do not have a constant relationship with the independent variable.","Relationship Between Financial Variables: The relationship between two financial variables refers to the variability of the variables and how they react to one another's movements. In simple terms, a relationship describes how the dependent variable moves as a result of the movement of the independent variable."
24,"If all of the unsystematic risks in a portfolio can be eliminated, then, what is the result?",a portfolio that contains only systematic risk,a portfolio that has an expected return of zero,a risk-free portfolio,such a portfolio cannot be constructed since there will always be an unsystematic risk in any portfolio,A,"The right choice is
A. a portfolio will have only systematic risk
.
Total risk is the blend of systematic and UR. When the UR is eliminated or zero, this signifies that total risk will be equivalent to systematic risk only. As an effect, the portfolio will have only systematic risk. Therefore, this is right.
Option B: A portfolio will have a zero expected return in case the security is not correlated to the market. This is analogous to the risk-free rate. Conclusively, this option is incorrect.
Option C: Risk-free portfolio is also referred to as a zero-beta portfolio, which has no systematic risk. The UR cannot be eliminated. Conclusively, this option is incorrect.
Option D: This option is incorrect because, with the assistance of the proper diversification of the portfolio, UR is possible to be eliminated.",Unsystematic Risk: Unsystematic risks (URs) are that portion of the total risk that is not caused by external factors and is encountered within a particular industry or may be security-related.

d. All of the above are factors affecting the market price of a foreign bond.
The value of a bond is directly connected to the movement of market interest rates. An increase in the foreign interest rate will lower the value of a foreign bond, and vice versa.

Option d is not correct because it is the value of the fiscal output of the economy.","Investment: The term ""investment demand"" is used to describe the need for companies to purchase tangible capital goods and services in order to either sustain or increase their current operations."
35,Return on investment:,is equal to the current prime rate.,provides a replacement value.,is net profit divided by investment.,establishes a value for the business.,C,"The answer is
c. is net profit divided by investment.
Return on investment is a metric used to determine an investors value or profitability. We determine return on investment by dividing net profit by the investment.
Other Options
a. is equal to the current prime rate - The current prime rate is the rate that financial institutions charge. It is the rate that customers with good credit receive.
b. provides a replacement value - a replacement value is the amount an insurance company pays in the event that there is theft of property.

Investments are essential in building a valuable financial portfolio, which provide the investor with security."
36,A rightward shift of the investment demand curve would be caused by a(an),increase in the expected rate of return on investment caused by an increase in business confidence.,a decrease in the expected rate of return on investment caused by a decrease in business confidence.,increase in the rate of interest.,a decrease in the rate of interest.,A,"The correct option is a. increase in the expected rate of return on investment caused by an increase in business confidence
It is correct because the investment demand curve will shift rightward as the expected returns on investment are high due to future expectancy and a rise in businesses performances. The human tendency reflects that individuals invest more where the return on expected is high and vice-versa.
Reason for incorrect options:-
Option b) is incorrect because the investment demand curve will shift to the left instead of the right if the expected returns are low.
Option c) is incorrect because the increase in the interest rate will increase the cost of borrowing, and the investment will decline.
Option d) is incorrect because a reduced interest rate will create movement in the curve instead of shifting the curve to the right.","Investment: Investment is one of the main components of the economy's GDP as it reflects individuals' confidence in the business. An increase in the investment demand creates a rightward shift in the investment demand curve, proposes raised GDP, and vice-versa."
37,"Relative to a buy and hold strategy, average arithmetic returns overstate the return on a portfolio.",True,False,,,A,"The statement is a. True.  The arithmetic average, or simple average, is always higher than the geometric average.  When evaluating investment returns, the latter metric is more appropriate and telling of true performance.",Buy-and-Hold Strategy: A buy-and-hold investment strategy is when where an investor acquires an asset and holds it for a relatively long period of time.  He or she is confident in the economic merit of the asset and does not react to short-term volatility in financial markets.
38,"Stocks have both diversifiable risk and undiversifiable risk, but only diversifiable risk is rewarded with higher expected returns.",True,False,,,B,"The above statement is
False.
Reason:
Unsystematic risk or Diversifiable risk are those risks that are in control of the management. For example, new competitors, financial risk, legal risk, goodwill risk, etc. These types of risk generally occur due to the internal environment and can be avoided but there are certain types of risk that cannot be neglected by an investor like an investor has invested funds into a healthcare stock. The investor may know about the various policies attached to it but on the other hand, the investor may not be informed about the new laws related to the healthcare product by the government.
Therefore, the diversifiable risk does not always reward you with higher returns since all risks are uncertain that can happen at any time. An investor will try to minimize the risk as much as possible in order to gain more but in financial instruments, risk cannot be neglected.","Risk: Risk is the situation where the result is exposed to danger. In financial terminology, the risk is the situation where certainty and uncertainty both lie. Every investment has its risk attached which an investor has to bear in order to gain profit."
39,"If an economy wants to increase its current level of investment, it must:",sacrifice future consumption,print more money,offer more stocks and bonds to financial investors,sacrifice current consumption,D,"The correct answer is
d. sacrifice current consumption
The present investment is a part of the present income of a consumer. The income of the consumer can be consumed or can be saved. If the consumer saves more money in financial institutions such as a bank, then the banks will get more funds to provide loans. The increase in the supply(SS) of funds will reduce the rate of interest of providing loans if the demand(DD) for the loans will remain constant. Then more consumers will take more loans to invest in businesses. Even one individual can directly invest in a business. If an individual reduces the present consumption then only can increase the amount of present investment when the present income level will be constant.
Similarly, an economy wants to increase its present investment. Then the present consumption level has to reduce if the present income level remains unchanged.
Additional Information:
a.
Sacrificing future consumption will increase future investment.
b.
The central government can print more money. But printing more money may not increase the investment and may only increase the consumption of the economy.
c.
Offering more stock and bonds is different from buying those bonds and stocks. A company can offer more bonds and stock, but investing in those stocks and bonds will depend on the financial investors. If the present incomes of the financial investors are constant then the investors have to reduce their present consumption to invest more in present.",Investment(I) An act that allocates resources such as money on the assets or items with an expectation to create and increase the profit and the income is known as investment.

A. the risk premium.
The risk premium is found by subtracting a low-risk option from the expected return for a high-risk one. For example, a low-risk investment that will return 4% to the investors, when compared with a high-risk investment that returns 7%, generates a risk premium of 3%.

41,Which of the following investment rules has the value additivity property?,the payback period method,the net present value method,the book rate of return method,the internal rate of return method,B,"The correct option is b)
The value of additivity attribute is contained in the investing guidelines for the net present value approach Additivity to value implies that the NPV of a project is all that matters in determining its worth to a company rate of discount. When a company invests in a project, it eliminates the possibility of the stockholder spending the same amount of money on a financial asset, known as an opportunity cost. The total net present value of a large building appears to be equal to the total of all intelligent and efficient investments.
Option a)
is incorrect because the payback period is determined by dividing the capital investment by the cashflows.
Option c)
is incorrect because the book rate of return is seen as a measure of the necessary investment return according to extensive empirical study.
Option d)
is incorrect because a helpful tool for comparing investments is the internal rate of return (IRR), which is the interest rate at which the total of all cash flows equals zero.",Investment-Rule: Any government legislation or regulation that promotes or impedes foreign investment in the regional economy is called an investment policy.

A strategy that aims to strike a balance between capital preservation and growth is called a balanced investing approach. It is often utilized by investors with moderate risk tolerance and comprises about an equal amount of equities and bonds. On the risk-reward scale, balanced investing strategies are at the center.","Investment Strategy: An investment plan or strategy is the name given to a collection of guidelines created to assist a single investor in achieving their monetary and investment objectives.

His investment counselor suggests an investment that pays no stated interest but will return $2,000 at the end of 3 years.",What annual rate of return will Mr. Singh earn with this investment?,"Mr. Singh is considering another investment, of equal risk, that earns an annual return of 8%. Which investment should he make, and why?",,,A,"Given:
The investment amount (PV) is $1,500.
The investment dollar return (FV) is $2,000.
The investment duration (t) is 3.
a.	Calculation of the annual rate of return (i):
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{FV}} &= {\rm\text{PV}} \times \left( {1 + {\rm\text{i}}} \right)_{}^{\rm\text{t}}\\

\$ 2,000 &= \$ 1,500 \times \left( {1 + {\rm\text{i}}} \right)_{}^3\\

\left( {1 + {\rm\text{i}}} \right)_{}^3 &= \frac{{\$ 2,000}}{{\$ 1,500}}\\

{\rm\text{i}} &= \sqrt[3]{{1.3333}} - 1

{/eq}
Further,
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{i}}&= 1.10064 - 1\\

&= 0.10064{\rm\text{ or }}10.06\%

{/eq}
The annual rate of return is
10.06%
.
b.
Mr. Singh should make an investment that his counselor suggests that provides a return of $2,000 at the end of 3rd year. The reason to select an investment that generates $2,000 at no stated interest is that this investment provides a higher annual return of 10.06% than the investment opportunity that pays only 8%.",Investment: Business institutions invest in potential investment options to generate profit on their business capital.

Bonds issued by a company are like loan borrowings taken from the public. If the bond size issued by the company is large, it will have a longer holding duration as well. Thus, investors won't be able to sell it easily. Therefore, the answer is true.
Since the possibility to sell a bond is less, firms are less liable to make principal payments and therefore will have funds for long durations.
