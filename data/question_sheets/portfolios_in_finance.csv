1,An effective process of capital allocation promotes productivity and provides an efficient market for buying and selling securities and obtaining and granting credit.,True,False,,,A,"The given statement is true.
The management can invest in other companies, buy back its shares, or issue dividends. These will lead to better position in the securities market. The organization will increase its profit and wealth by effective allocation.",Capital Allocation: Capital allocation is the investment of financial resources of an organization in the most efficient manner. It is done to increase to increase the shareholder's wealth. It is an important decision and all the options should be evaluated.
2,Many current and retired Enron Corp. employees had their 401k retirement accounts wiped out when Enron collapsed because:,they had to pay huge fines for obstruction of justice,their 401k accounts were held outside the company,their 401k accounts were not well diversified,None of the above,C,"The answer is
C. their 401k accounts were not well diversified
Their retirement account was invested heavily on Enron stock. That explained why their money was wiped out when the stock price dropped down significantly.",Retirement Plan: A retirement plan is a financial plan that generates income and protection to a person after his retirement. A well-constructed plan will secure that person's living standards and stabilize his wealth.
3,"During the financial crisis in 2008-2009, investors who were diversified across industries:",experienced no losses.,experienced large gains.,experienced significant losses because most industries were suffering from weak economic conditions.,experienced losses in financial services companies but not in other industries.,C,"The correct answer is
C. Experienced significant losses because most industries were suffering from weak economic conditions
.
Investors who had only invested across industry sectors suffered huge losses during the financial crisis because most businesses in these industries were impacted by the prevailing economic conditions. Diversifying one's portfolio across industries does fully hedge against possible risks because it is highly likely that the companies in the industries would be affected by the same risks during a crisis. Thousands of industries were profoundly affected by the financial crisis, which took a heavy toll on both people and organizations.","Portfolio Diversification: There are different ways of diversifying one's portfolio, which can be achieved by investing in a variety of businesses and industries. As an investor, one does not have to possess a large number of stocks from just one firm. They may acquire from firms in the same industry or purchase other forms of investment. An individual's whole investment portfolio is at risk of losing value if they have all of their money on one investment vehicle."
4,A stock has a beta of 1.14 and an expected return of 10.5 percent. A risk-free asset currently early is 2.4 percent.,What is the expected return on a portfolio that is equally invested in the two assets?,"If a portfolio of the two assets has a beta of 0.92, what are the portfolio weights?",,,A,"a.
E(rp) = E(r) x stock weight + E(r) x Risk-free asset weight
E(rp) = 10.5% x 0.50 + 2.4% x 0.50
E(rp) = 5.25% + 1.2%
E(rp) = 6.45%
b.
Let the portfolio weight of the stock be x and the risk-free asset be (1-x).
Beta (Asset) = Stock beta x Stock weight + Beta x Risk-free asset weight
0.92 = 1.14 x X + 0 x (1-X)
0.92 = 1.14X + 0
X = 0.92/1.14
X = 0.8070
Therefore, the portfolio weights are
80.7%
and 0.193(1-0.8070), or
19.3%
.",Portfolio Weights: The portfolio weights of the stock are assigned systematically by the portfolio manager to minimize the portfolio risk. Higher-risk assets are given a low weightage while low to medium-risk assets have a high weightage in the portfolio.
5,The measure of risk for a security held in a diversified portfolio is:,Specific risk,Standard deviation of returns,Reinvestment risk,Covariance,D,"The correct answer is option d.
Covariance
A security with a high positive covariance with the portfolio is riskier in a portfolio context because its returns are more closely tied to the portfolio's overall performance. Conversely, a security with a low or negative covariance with the portfolio is not as risky in a portfolio context because its returns are less affected by the portfolio's overall performance.
Reasons for incorrect options:
a
: The specific risk is the risk that is unique to a particular security and cannot be diversified away in a portfolio and is not a way to assess the risk related to the fund held in a diversified portfolio.
b
: It calculates a security's overall risk but ignores the impact of diversification on a portfolio. Therefore, it may overstate a security risk held in a diversified portfolio.
c
: This is the risk that the future earnings from an investment may not be invested again at the identical profit level as the initial amount invested. Hence it is not a measure of the risk of a security held in a portfolio.","Diversified Portfolio: The term diversified portfolio is a group of investments developed to lessen risk and increase revenues by allocating distinct holdings across several asset categories, including shares and obligations."
6,Combining negatively correlated assets having the same expected return results in a portfolio with _____ level of expected return and _____ level of risk.,the same; a higher,the same; a lower,a higher; a lower,a lower; a higher,B,"The correct answer is Option B.
Option B is correct as combining the negatively correlated assets will not affect the expected returns as the individual investments have the same expected return. And the expected risk will be lower as the risk is segregated and divided, which reduces the total risk; e.g., if any of the stocks will be facing bad or low returns, then the other good-performing fund will help the portfolio
.","Portfolio: A portfolio is the troupes of the various investments in a single Demat account, such as Shares, bonds, funds and commodities. It reduces the level of risk by organizing & highlighting the price fluctuations."
7,Proper asset allocation can:,increase your wealth.,decrease your assets.,increase your dividend income and decrease your interest income.,increase your expenses.,A,"Option a) Increase your wealth
is the correct answer.
Reason:
A proper allocation and utilization of an organization's total assets can eventually increase the firm's wealth since the assets are items that provide future benefits to the firm. If a partnership firm liquidates in nature, the organization's total assets are distributed amongst the partners after paying off the firm's liabilities. When analyzing the firm's value according to the market, a model known as the Book value determines the value or worth of the firm with its total assets. Therefore, assets benefit the organization in cash and increase wealth.
Reason for incorrect options:
Option b is incorrect because assets will decrease when sold.
Option c is incorrect because these are related to the shareholder's equity of the firm.
Option d is incorrect because increasing expenses will lead to a decrease in the firm's profit.",Allocation: It is a term used when an organization decides to allocate its funds into different investment assets in the market. Allocation is done after the financing activity where the owners have arranged the funds.

11,A stock has a beta of 1.35 and an expected return of 16 percent. A risk-free asset currently earns 4.8 percent.,What is the expected return on a portfolio that is equally invested in the two assets?,"If a portfolio of the two assets has a beta of 0.95, what are the portfolio weights?","If a portfolio of the two assets has an expected return of 8 percent, what is its beta?","If a portfolio of the two assets has a beta of 2.70, what are the portfolio weights? How do you interpret the weights for the two assets in this case?",A,"a.
The expected return on the portfolio equally invested in the two assets should be = 0.5 x R1 + 0.5 x R2
Expected return of the stock, R1 = 16%
Expected return of the risk-free asset = 4.8%
Therefore, the portfolio return is = 0.5 x 16% + 0.5 x 4.8%
= 8% + 2.4%
=
10.4%
b.
The stock beta is 1.35 while the portfolio has a beta of 0.95. The risk-free asset's beta is zero.
Therefore, Portfolio beta is = W(s) x B(s) + W(r) x 0
Or, 0.95 = W(s) x 1.35
Or W(s) = 0.7037 or 70.37%
Therefore, the weight of the stock in the portfolio is
70.37%
and the weight of the risk-free assets is = 1 - 0.7037
= 0.2963 or
29.63%
c.
Let the weights in the portfolio be X for the stock and 1 - X for the risk-free asset respectively
The expected return of the portfolio, P(r) is = R1 x X + R2 x (1-X)
Or, 8% = 16X% + 4.8% - 4.8X%
Or, 3.2% = 11.2X%
Or, X = 0.2857
1 - X = 1 - 0.2857 = 0.7143
Therefore, the stock's weight is 28.57% while the risk-free asset's weight is 71.43%. We, now calculate the portfolio beta with the given weights as follows:
Pb = Beta of stock x weight of stock + Beta of risk-free asset x weight of risk-free asset
= 1.35 x 0.2857 + 0
=
0.39
d.
The stock beta is 1.35 while the portfolio has a beta of 2.7. The risk-free asset's beta is zero.
Therefore, Portfolio beta is = W(s) x B(s) + W(r) x 0
Or, 2.7 = W(s) x 1.35
Or W(s) = 2 or 200%
Therefore,
200%
of the portfolio's weight(i.e. the stock's weight) has to be invested in the stock to result in this beta. There will be no investment in the risk-free asset in this case as it will not be possible in this situation.",Managing Risky Investments: Managing risky investments effectively in a portfolio of assets is the key to its best performance.

13,The benefit from diversification is far greater when diversification occurs across asset types.,True,False,,,A,"The correct option is
a. True
.
A successful diversification should be based on selecting a mix of asset classes, for instance, holding bonds, stocks, ETFs, futures contracts, precious metals, etc. If an investor holds only one class of asset, the full benefits from diversification cannot be achieved. This is because different types of assets may react in a different way to the same macroeconomic change, which reduces the risk of an investment portfolio.",Diversification: Diversification is a portfolio management strategy that is focused on minimizing the risk of the investment. This strategy helps in mitigating losses through a proper allocation of funds.

b. Increase the unsystematic risk of the portfolio
When the number of investing securities reduces, the entire portfolio will be less diversified, which means it will be exposed to higher unsystematic risk.","Portfolio: An investment portfolio consists of several securities, in which it will reduce the portfolio's risk. The portfolio can achieve a lower unsystematic risk if subsequent securities have inverse relationship with each other."
15,Investment levels depend mainly on:,high levels of consumption in the economy.,the rate of return on capital.,tax incentives.,strong government demand.,B,"The correct answer is choice
b.
Investment involves the spending made on capital goods to produce services and commodities in the economy. It is mainly determined by the ROR on the capital, which is the benefits expected from the investment. Investment will be high when the ROR on capital is high. Contrarily, investment will be low when the rate of return on capital is low. The ROR on capital shows how effectively a firm is turning the capital into profits.","Investment: Investment is the equipment, plants, and other capital goods needed to offer services or build commodities.

Use portfolio concepts to explain why people buy life insurance in spite of low expected returns.",,A,"(a)
The expected return on life insurance is calculated as normal stock. The outcome of each event is amplified by its potential for emergence, followed by a summary of these products.
For example, a one-year policy pays $ 20,000 per death, and the probability in that year is two percent. As a result there is a 98% chance of a zero refund and a 2% chance of a refund of $ 20,000
Expected return = 0.98 ($ 0) + 0.02 ($ 20,000) = $ 400
This expected benefit can be compared to the premium paid. Here the fees will be higher due to sales and management costs and company profits which indicate that there is an unexpected amount of return on investment policy.
(b)
Here, there is a perfectly negative relationship between the benefit to a life insurance policy and the return to the person in charge of the policy. In addition, these events are not related.

29,For diversification to reduce risk:,the returns on the individual securities should be highly correlated,the prices of the stocks should be stable,the returns on the individual securities should be negatively correlated,one firm should offer dividends and the other should offer capital gains,C,"A. Incorrect. If returns on individual securities are highly correlated, it might increase the overall risk for the portfolio since these securities can experience a large reduction in price simultaneously.
B. Incorrect. If the prices of the stocks are stable, the diversification strategy is not necessary.
C. Correct.
The negative correlation indicates that the prices of individual securities will move in opposite directions simultaneously. Hence, it helps to reduce the overall risk of a portfolio.
D. Incorrect. Dividends and capital gains should be recognized as returns to investors.

.
For a portfolio, the diversification process involves having investments in different asset classes like bonds and equities. Furthermore, in each asset class, securities of different sectors and different firms within the same sector are considered.
The total risk of a diversified portfolio cannot be eliminated. It can be bifurcated into systematic risk and unsystematic risk. Systematic risk is a market-wide risk that affects all the securities and cannot be eliminated while unsystematic risk is a firm-specific risk that can be reduced by diversification.",Portfolio: An investment portfolio is usually constructed by complying with the diversification principle. The objective behind a diversified portfolio is to maximize returns without taking incremental risks.

32,Diversification reduces:,systematic risk,unsystematic risk,market risk,purchasing power risk,B,"The correct answer is option
B. unsystematic risk
.
The diversification of a portfolio reduces the unsystematic risk, which represents the risk associated with a given firm. The systematic risk or the market risk is a risk that affects all the securities in a market and hence, cannot be diversified. The purchasing power risk represents the inflation risk due to which the purchasing power of individuals decreases.",Diversification: The concept of diversification is used to reduce the risk of a portfolio without affecting the expected returns. It is usually done by having securities from various sectors and various firms in a given sector.
33,What is the purpose of diversification?,Increase the risk of your portfolio.,Lower the overall risk of your portfolio.,Maximize possible returns.,None of the above.,B,"The correct option is
(B.) Lower the overall risk of your portfolio.
A primary objective of creating a portfolio is to minimize the overall risk of the investment. Every financial asset has its own risks. If we invest all our money in only one asset then we will be completely exposed to its risk. However, if we diversify our investments into various instruments. Our exposure will spread across the instruments and might reduce the overall risk of the portfolio.
As the main motive for creating a portfolio is to reduce the risk, options (A) and (C) are incorrect.","Portfolio: A portfolio is a combination of financial assets in a specified proportion.

A well-diversified investor can avoid the unsystematic risk of each underlying asset or security. Thus, this risk is irrelevant to a well-diversified investor.
B, C, D. Incorrect. Non-diversifiable risk, systematic risk, and market risk are indifferent. This risk happens to all business sectors in the economy, which is not avoidable. Alternatively, a diversification strategy cannot eliminate systematic risk.","Diversification: Diversification refers to an investment strategy in that an investor will split the available fund into different investment categories.

(A) less; more.
Diversification means dividing investment amounts into different types and classes of assets to bring down the overall risk. The benefit of diversification is that if the return from one security is low, the overall impact on the portfolio is also less.

It displays the combinations of risky and risk-free assets that can provide the best-anticipated yield for a specific level of risk (standard deviation). The slope of the capital allocation line depicts the additional return known as the total risk premium, which the investors demand for taking on additional risk.
The explanation of the incorrect options is as follows:
B) The capital allocation line does not comprise two risky assets. The investment opportunity set made up of a risky asset and a risk-free asset is particularly represented by the capital allocation line. The capital allocation line displays the efficient frontier, which is the collection of assets, and when combined, it provides the greatest anticipated return for a particular degree of risk.
C) The portfolios represented by the capital allocation line do not serve the same utility for a given investor. A measure of an investor's individual choice or satisfaction with various degrees of risk and yield is called utility. The capital allocation line, which does not account for the preferences of individual investors, is a graphical depiction of the risk-return tradeoff for portfolios that include both risky and risk-free assets.
D) The capital allocation line that depicts the efficient frontier, which is the collection of portfolios, merges risky and risk-free assets and offers the highest expected return for a given amount of risk.

For example, let's say you are an investor and buy stock in 5 companies, all of which are citrus farmers from Florida.    If a deep freeze were to effect Florida and wipe out a large portion of the citrus crops, then it is likely that all 5 stock prices would fall in response.   However, if only one of your 5 stocks was a citrus farmer and the others were in different industries, then it is likely that a deep freeze in Florida would only effect that one stock, thereby lessening the risk of your overall portfolio.
The answer is:
A) Risk-averse investors often choose companies from different industries for their portfolios because the correlation of returns is less than if all the companies came from the same industry.
The other answers are incorrect due to the following:
B) Risk-averse investors often select portfolios that include only companies from the same industry group because the familiarity reduces the risk.
-- this is not the case; choosing companies from the same industry group actually increases the risk, as seen in the citrus farmer example above.
C) Only wealthy investors can diversify their portfolios because a portfolio must contain at least 50 stocks to gain the benefits of diversification.

44,The security market line defines expected returns for diversified portfolios.,True,False,,,A,"The correct answer is option a.
True
The Securities Market Line (SML), an indicator of an asset's sensitivity to market risk, shows the association between the expected return of securities or the portfolio and its beta.
The SML is predicated on the notion that investors have well-diversified portfolios, i.e., various assets with imperfectly correlated holdings. Investors that maintain diversified portfolios might lessen their exposure to unsystematic risk, which can be reduced through diversification and is the risk particular to individual assets.
Therefore, the SML defines the expected returns for diversified portfolios rather than individual assets. It displays the expected return that investors can expect to receive in exchange for accepting a specific amount of systematic risk, which is a risk that cannot be mitigated by diversification. By comparing the expected return of a security or portfolio with the required return according to its level of risk, investors can determine whether the asset is undervalued or overvalued and make informed investment decisions.",Diversified Portfolio: A diversified portfolio includes different types of stocks available in the market to reduce the risk of stock price uncertainty and maximize investment earnings.

Explanation
One way to reduce financial risk is to diversify in a variety of assets, both financial and physical. Diversification of risk is the strategy employed by investors to manage risk. Diversification is achieved by creating a portfolio that includes investing in different assets such as stock, bonds, and commodities. Creating a portfolio will require one to invest in assets with different risk levels.","Financial risk: Investors seek alternative opportunities to invest their funds and expect to earn economic returns in future periods. A key component in investment analysis is the risk-return tradeoff.

One type of risk is the financial risk which represents the probability of defaulting on payments when it is due."
49,Which of the following workers is most likely to be asked to post a performance bond?,car salesman,basketball coach,fireman,armored car guard,A,"The correct answer is option (a) car, salesman
A car salesman is likely to be asked for a performance bond because his job's nature is highly risky. Selling a car at times needs the trust from the employer to freely move around with job cars while advertising them and when doing delivery. This is because a salesman can vanish with an employer's or a client's car perpetuating a considerable loss. Also, a client pays for a car while in the showroom if the salesman has a performance bond. It ensures that the car will be delivered after paying. A car salesman needs a performance bond to execute duties according to the contract to earn the trust of both the employer and clients. The salesman should also avoid any losses to the employer due to carelessness.","Performance Bond: A performance bond is a bond type issued in a contract to one party to act as a guarantee against the other party's failure to meet the requirements specified in the contract. It is prevalent to sellers who must issue performance bonds to assure the buyer if the item on sale is not delivered. An insurance company or a bank issues it and is also known as a contract bond. It was initiated by the Miller Act, which stipulated that it covers all public work of $100 000 and above."
