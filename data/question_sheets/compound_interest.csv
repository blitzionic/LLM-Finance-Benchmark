1,"A quick, rough estimate of the time required for money to double can be obtained by dividing which of the following numbers by the compound interest rate?",56,64,72,100,C,"The correct option is
(c) 72
Rule of 72,
Under compound interest, the rule of 72 helps us to determine in how much time the accumulated amount will be twice of the initial investment. It can be roughly calculated by dividing 72 by the compound interest. The answer will be the number of years in which the initial investment will be doubled.","Compound Interest: Compound interest is the interest that earns interest on itself. In financial mathematics, compound interest is used in annuities, loan schedules, time value of money, investment and insurance plans, etc."
2,"An investment of $30,000 increased to $80,000 over an 8-year period. What was the compound rate of return on the investment?",10.80%,The interest rate cannot be determined.,13.00%,9.00%,C,"The correct option is
(c.) 13.0%
Under compound interest,
{eq}\text{Accumulated Amount} = \text{Initial Amount} \times (1 + i)^{n} {/eq}
where,
i = interest rate
n = number of years
Here,
Accumulated Amount = $80,000
Initial Amount = $30,000
n = 8 years
Putting values, we can solve for i
{eq}\text{Accumulated Amount} = \text{Initial Amount} \times (1 + i)^{n}\\ \$80,000 = \$30,000 \times (1 + i)^{8}\\ (1 + i)^{8} = \dfrac{\$80,000}{\$30,000}\\ (1 + i)^{8} = 2.6667\\ \text{Taking log on both sides}\\ 8 \times log(1 + i) = log(2.6667)\\ 8 \times log(1 + i) = 0.98084\\ log(1 + i) = \dfrac{0.98084}{8}\\ log(1 + i) = 0.122605\\ \text{Taking anti-log on both sides} 1 + i = 1.1304\\ i = 0.1304\\ i = 13.04\% {/eq}
The closest option is (c.) 13%",Compound Interest: Compound Interest is the interest that earns interest on itself. The accumulation under compound interest is faster than that in simple interest because of compounding.

8,The compound interest method refers to:,Interest is calculated only on the original principle.,Interest is calculated on a dollar received today.,Interest is calculated on both the original principle and on all interest accumulated since the beginning of the interest period.,All of the above.,C,"The correct answer is
c. Interest is calculated on both the original principal and on all interest accumulated since the beginning of the interest period.
Interest charged on a compounded basis implies that interest is calculated on the initial principal and the interest accumulated since the beginning. So, the interest keeps increasing with each period, and the money multiplies at a faster rate when compared to simple interest. Thus, compound interest makes investments more desirable but debt riskier.
The other options are incorrect.
a.
Interest is calculated only on the original principal:
When the interest is calculated only on the original principal amount without considering the accumulated interest, it is called simple interest.
b.
Interest is calculated on a dollar received today:
The interest calculated on a dollar received today does not represent compound interest.",Interest: Interest is the cost of funds lent by the lender to the borrower. It is the compensation to the lender for providing capital and bearing the risk involved in the process. Interest is usually expressed as a percentage.

10,"When interest is paid on both the principal amount and prior interest earned, this is called:",accounting rate of return.,the discount factor.,compound interest.,simple interest.,C,"The correct answer is option c. compound interest.
Compound interest is a type of interest that is applied not only to the principal amount of an investment or loan, but also to the interest accrued during the lifetime of that investment or loan.
For example, if a savings account earns compound interest where interest is compounded monthly, then the interest earned at the end of each compounding period, or month in this case, is added to the balance of the account, and then interest accrues on that amount as well as the principal amount invested.
The explanations for why the other answer options are incorrect are as follows:
Choice A. Accounting rate of return:
This is not a correct option, because an accounting rate of return is used to calculate the profitability of an investment as opposed to being a type of interest earned on an account.
Choice B. The discount factor:
The discount factor is not a type of interest, but rather, it is used to calculate the present value of future cash flows. Thus, this is not a correct answer option.
Choice D. Simple interest:
This option is not correct, because simple interest is a type of interest in which interest is only paid on the principal amount and not on any prior interest earned.","Principal Amount: In accounting and finance, the term 'principal amount' refers to original amount invested in an interest-bearing account or investment. In terms of loans, principal amount can also refer to the original amount borrowed from a lender."
11,Which of the given interest rates and compounding periods would provide the best investment?,"2% per year, compounded semiannually","2% per year, compounded monthly","2% per year, compounded continuously",,C,"When everything else is held constant, a higher compounding frequency always yields a higher investment. This is because the interest is added back into the investment more often, meaning that future interest calculations are made with a larger balance. If interest is compounded semiannually, it is compounded twice per year. If it is compounded monthly, that is 12 times per year. Continuously compounded interest is a little different, as interest is compounded more frequently than once per second! Thus, continuously compounding is the highest compounding frequency, and we want to use that.
We can illustrate this problem with some calculations to support our claims. The following three calculations use an initial balance of $1000 placed into an account earning 2% interest for 10 years. The only difference is the compounding frequency. The first calculation uses semiannually compounded interest, the second uses monthly compounded interest, and the third uses continuously compounded interest. While the differences in the final amount are slight, we can see that continuously compounded interest does yield the highest amount in the end.
{eq}\begin{align*} A_a &= 1000\left(1 + \dfrac{0.02}{2}\right)^{2(10)}\\ &=1000(1+0.01)^{20}\\ &= 1000(1.01)^{20}\\ &= 1000(1.22019)\\ &= 1220.19\\ \\ A_b&= 1000\left( 1+\dfrac{0.02}{12}\right)^{12(10)}\\ &= 1000(1+0.001667)^{120}\\ &= 1000(1.001667)^{120}\\ &=1000(1.221199)\\ &=1221.20\\ \\ A_c &= 1000e^{0.02(10)}\\ &=1000e^{0.2}\\ &= 1000(1.22140)\\ &= 1221.40 \end{align*} {/eq}","Compound Interest: The most common application of exponential functions comes in finance.

12,"You have 15 more years to achieve your goal of being a millionaire. At an exponential growth of 10 percent annually, how much do you need to invest today to reach your goal?","$22,026 ","$262,910 ","$223,130 ","$100,000 ",B,"The equation for calculating the compounding interest is an exponential equation.
Using this formula, we can solve for the minimum amount of money that must be invested to attain 1,000,000 after 15 years if the interest is 10 percent compounded annually.
{eq}P_{n}\;=\;P_{0}\;\times\;(1\;+\;\frac{r}{k})^{Nk} {/eq}

We will now substitute the values in the equation. We know that if the interest is compounded annually then the number of compounding periods in a year is 1.
{eq}\begin{aligned} P_{n}\;&=\;P_{0}\;\times\;(1\;+\;\frac{r}{k})^{Nk}\\ 1,000,000\;&=\;P_{0}\;\times\;(1\;+\;\frac{0.10}{1})^{(15)(1)}\\ P_{0}\;&=\;\frac{1,000,000}{(1\;+\;\frac{0.10}{1})^{(15)(1)}}\\ P_{0}\;&=\;\frac{1,000,000}{(1\;+\;0.10)^{15}}\\ P_{0}\;&=\;\frac{1,000,000}{(1.10)^{15}}\\ P_{0}\;&=\;239,392.0494\\ \end{aligned} {/eq}
The minimum amount that must be invested is approximately 239,392 in order to attain 1,000,000 after 15 years.

If Marc sells the ball five years from now, what percent profit will he make?",50%,75%,25%,100%,A,"The answer is A, Marc will profit 50 percent if the value of the card grows by 6% each year.
The key to solving this problem is to perform a series of operations. As the final price will occur seven years after Marc bought the card for $450, the original price needs to be multiplied by 1.06 for the first year, then the product of that calculation multiplied by 1.06 for the second year. Each year will involve multiplying the previous year's product by 1.06, which represents the original price plus the 6 percent increase, or the value of 106 percent of the original price.
