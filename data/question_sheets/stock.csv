2,"Goode Inc.'s stock has a required rate of return of 11.50%, and it sells for $18.00 per share. Goode's dividend is expected to grow at a constant rate of 7.00%. What was the last dividend?",$0.77,$0.62,$0.92,$0.76,D,"The answer is
D. $0.76.
Summary:
Recent dividend = D0
Required rate of return (I) = 11.50%
Price (P0) = $18
Constant growth rate (g) = 7%
Determine the recent dividend (D0):
{eq}P0 = \displaystyle \frac{D0 \times (1 + g)}{I - g} \\

$18 = \displaystyle \frac{D0 \times (1 + 7\%)}{11.5\% - 7\%} \\

4,Common stock owners typically expect to make money on stocks by receiving:,interest and dividends.,interest and capital gains.,dividends and capital gains.,dividends and rental income.,C,"The answer is
C) dividends and capital gains.
The common stock will make dividends to investors if the firm generates sufficient profit. In addition, investors can obtain a capital gain from selling stocks if the firm represents a potential growth in the future.
A common stock makes no interest payment or rental income since it is an equity security.","Common Stocks: Within a corporation, common stocks are shares of the firm that represents the business ownership. Compared to preferred stockholders, common stockholders have the voting right for the firm's strategies. However, common stockholders will receive lower dividends."
5,Stocks with high price-earnings ratios are commonly referred to as _____ stocks.,income,value,growth,geometric,C,"The correct answer is
option c. growth.
The P/E ratio is measured using the price of a security per share and the earnings per share. It is a widely used metric by investors while determining the intrinsic value of shares. A high P/E ratio indicates that investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock based on its strong growth potential. So, companies that are expected to grow fast usually have a higher P/E ratio as the investors are willing to pay more for a share of the company's future growth. Therefore, such stocks are commonly referred to as growth stocks.
Explanations of incorrect options:
Option a: Income stock refers to a matured company's stock that typically has a long track record of paying a consistent dividend to its shareholders.
Option b: Stocks with low P/E ratios are called value stocks. Investors invest in these stocks when the leading P/E ratio is below the justified P/E.
Option d: Geometric is not a relevant term associated with stocks based on P/E ratios.","Justified Price Multiple: A justified price multiple is the multiplier value of the stock if it is fairly valued. If the actual price is more than the justified price multiplier, the stock is overpriced, and if the actual price is less than the justified price multiplier, the stock is undervalued. The justified P/E ratio used by investors and analysts is a variation of the regular P/E ratio."

9,"The common stock of Zoroaster, Inc. pays a constant annual dividend. Thus, the market price of Zoroaster stock will:",decrease over time,increase when the market rate of return increases,increase over time,also remain constant,D,"The answer is
d. decrease when the market rate of return increases
If a stock makes constant dividends on an annual basis, the value of a stock can be determined below:
{eq}\text{Value} = \displaystyle \frac{\text{Annual dividend}}{\text{Required rate of return}} {/eq}

A)Decrease by $540000.
When a company purchases its own stock, such stocks are called treasury stock. Treasury stock is a contra-equity account that reduces the stockholders' equity balance.
Here the company purchases 18,000 shares of its own at $30 each. So the treasury stock account has a balance of $30 X 18,000 = $540,000

12,Which of the following is a stock variable as defined inMacronotesA?,income,capital,investment,profit,B,"The correct option is
B. capital
A stock indicates an amount present at a given time and may have accrued over time. In contrast, a flow variable has a specific value and is measured over a predetermined time frame. It is represented as a unit of time and is bounded by time. Capital is considered a stock variable because it is measured at a particular time. Over the stipulated term, a corporation expands its capital stock by investing in its current capital assets. When assessing a firm's overall availability of capital resources at a certain moment, the total quantity of capital collected and available in the firm's storage at that moment is referred to as the stock of capital. Capital is thus a stock variable since it is measured at a specific period.
The other options are incorrect:
A. income. Income is the compensation a person receives for doing labor-related services. An individual's income is calculated as the sum of their earnings over a given period rather than at a single point in time. Hence, income is a flow variable.
C. investment. Investing is the process through which capital assets are acquired. Investments are made over an extended period, and the return on investment cannot be realized immediately. Thus, investments are flow variables.
D. profit. Profit is earned by a person or a corporation on possible investments over a specified period. It cannot be estimated at any given time. Hence, profit is a flow concept rather than a stock concept.","Stock: In economic terms, a stock is a volume that can be measured economically at a certain time. In contrast to a flow, a stock has no apparent temporal dimension. Either stock- or flow-based economic variables can exist."

C, i.e., $2,000,000
,
Explanation:
Computation of the stock dividend:
The stock dividend is the percentage of dividend declared, i.e., 100%, out of the outstanding shares at par value, i.e., (40,000 shares @$25)
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{Stock dividend}} &= {\rm\text{Outstanding share}} \times {\rm\text{Percentage}} \times {\rm\text{Par value per share}}\\

&= 40,000 \times 100\%  \times \$ 25\\

&= \$ 1,000,000

\end{align*}

{/eq}
Thus, the stock dividend is $1,000,000.
Computation of the capital stock:
The capital stock is the cumulative value of the existing capital stock, i.e., $1,000,000, and the stock dividend declared, i.e., $1,000,000.
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{Capital stock}} &= {\rm\text{Existing capital stock}} + {\rm\text{Stock dividend}}\\

&= \$ 1,000,000 + \$ 1,000,000\\

&= \$ 2,000,000

D. $25.16.
In this case, the current stock price can be determined according to the constant growth model, in which all dividends are discounted back to the present at the investor's required return.
Summary:
Recent dividend (D0) = $1.50
Growth rate (g) = 4%
Required rate of return (I) = 10.2%
Determine the stock's intrinsic value:
{eq}\text{Intrinsic Value} = \displaystyle \frac{D0\times (1 + g)}{I - g} \\

When the business sells a no-par value stock, Cash should be debited for the total proceeds, Common Stock should be credited for stated value, and Paid-in Capital in Excess of Stated Value account should reflect the excess of proceeds over the stated value.",Stated Value: The stated value of a stock is the value assigned to it by the issuing company. It represents the company's perception of the stock's worth and is assigned to a stock with no par value.
30,Authorized capital stock is shares:,listed in the charter.,issued to the corporation's officers.,sold and in stockholder possession.,that pay dividends.,A,"The correct answer is option a. listed in the charter.
Authorized capital stock is the maximum number of shares of stock that a corporation is legally allowed to issue, as specified in its charter. This number represents the upper limit of shares that can be sold to investors or distributed among shareholders.
Therefore, option (a) is correct: authorized capital stock is shares listed in the corporation's charter. It means that the charter specifies the maximum number of shares that the company may issue, and this number is recorded as the authorized capital stock.
The authorized capital stock is different from issued capital stock, which represents the actual number of shares that have been distributed or sold to investors and are currently in possession of stockholders. It means that options (b) and (c) are incorrect.
Finally, option (d) is also incorrect because the payment of dividends is not dependent on whether the stock is authorized or issued, but rather on the company's financial performance and dividend policies.","Stock: From an accounting perspective, the stock is recorded as part of the equity section of the balance sheet and represents the residual interest in the company's assets after all liabilities have been deducted."

Stocks offer returns in the form of cash and stock dividends and an increase in the stock price called capital gain.
32,The ratio that measures the income earned by each share of common stock is:,number of times interest charges are earned,dividend yield,earnings per share,dividend per share,C,"The correct option is C.
Profit per share, also known as the Earnings Per Share Ratio, is one of the most helpful metrics for evaluating a company's financial health and stock price (EPS). This is an essential factor in determining earnings per share. Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing a company's net profit by the total number of outstanding common shares. EPS, a popular statistic for determining corporate value, shows how much money a firm produces for each share of its stock.
Thus, earning per share is the ratio that measures the income earned by each share of common stock.","Common Stock: The sort of stock most individuals invests in its common stock, which represents a portion of ownership in a business. In addition to the potential for dividends and capital growth, the common stock also comes with voting rights. In accounting, a company's balance sheet contains details on its common shares. Simply explained, each share of common stock corresponds to a portion of a company's ownership. Common stock may increase in value if a business performs well or if the value of its assets rises. On the other side, a common stock's value can drop if a business is struggling."

C. assuming a short position in
A. Incorrect. If the stock price is expected to drop in the future, the long position is not an appropriate strategy since it might cause a huge capital loss.
B. Incorrect. A drop in the market value of a stock will not cause a decreasing trend in the market. Hence, assuming a bearish outlook is not relevant in this case.
C. Correct. If there is a decrease in the market value of a stock, a short position can help investors to earn a capital gain since investors can sell stocks for a higher price while they can repurchase these stocks at a lower price in the future.
D. Incorrect. A market order will be executed at the current bid, which causes a capital loss in a bearish market.",Market Value Of A Stock: The market value of a stock represents the trading price of a stock between sellers and buyers in the securities exchange market.

Option
a. the value assigned per share by the corporate charter
is the correct answer. The number of shares that the investors held in the firm is the basis for determining the amount of ownership in the company. The stock certificate's par value has already been allocated when it is received by the investor/shareholder.
Option b. The dividend value of the stock is incorrect. The dividend value of stock refers to the value of return per stock owned by the investor/shareholder.
Option c. maximum selling price of the stock. Par value is different from the maximum selling price.

Cash
$170,000
Common Stock No-Par Value
$170,000
Cash is debited for coming into the business, and the common stock account reflects the capital raised from issuing stock.
Working note:
Cash raised from the stock issuance = Shares issued × Issue price per share
Cash raised from the stock issuance = 10,000 shares × $17
Cash raised from the stock issuance = $170,000",Stock Issuance: Stock issuance is a company's way to raise capital and invest in the business. The cost of new equity is always higher as it includes flotation costs. A company can issue common and preferred shares to investors.

Analysis
A. total shareholders' equity.
Total stockholders' equity doesn't just include share capital but also retained earnings.
B. contributed capital.
Contributed capital represents the total proceeds from stock issuance (par value plus premium). It means the share capital raised by a company.
C. retained earnings.
Share capital represents the capital raised from shares. Retained earnings represent the earnings generated from investing the share capital in the operations.
D. common shareholders' equity.
Common shareholders' equity represents the net worth available to equity shareholders.","Capital Structure: A company's capital structure is built based on its financial activities, which include funding from long-term sources such as stocks and debentures.

37,The term used to describe the stock representing the primary ownership interest in a corporation is:,common stock.,retrained earnings.,financing activity.,dividends.,A,"The correct answer is
a. common stock
.
Common stock indicates the primary ownership in a corporation because the shareholders who hold equity shares are the company's owners, who will not be redeemed the par value but will be distributed the net assets. Retained earnings refer to the accumulation of a portion of net income earned each year and belongs to the common shareholders. A financing activity doesn't indicate ownership. For example, preferred stock and debt are financing sources but don't indicate ownership. Also, dividends are paid as returns and are not an indicator of ownership.","External Sources of Capital: For a corporation, except for the retained earnings, all the sources from where capital can be raised are external.

39,The value of a common stock is based on its,Past performance.,Dividend yield.,Current earnings.,Value of future benefits to the holder.,D,"The correct answer is option
D) Value of future benefits to the holder.
One of the methods used by fundamental analysts is to value the stock based on the cash flows it is expected to generate in the future. The current value of a stock is the present value of all the anticipated future cash inflows in the form of dividends, capital appreciation, or any other benefit that the holder will receive for owning the stock.
The other options are not correct because:
Option A: Past performance: It is not a valid choice because the past performance is already reflected in the current market price of the stock.
Option B: Dividend yield: This is not a valid choice because the dividend yield refers to the percentage of dividends earned over the market price. It is not a cash flow that can be discounted to arrive at the value of the stock.
Option C: Current earnings: It is not a valid choice because the holders of the stock may not receive the entire earnings but a percentage of the earnings as dividends. The expected dividends earned from the earnings will be used to determine the stock's fair value.",Common Stock: Common stock represents a claim of the shareowner on a portion of the issuing entity's earnings and assets.

d. less than the first-stage growth rate.
A multi-stage dividend growth model is a version of a dividend discount model, which assumes that the stock's dividends grow at a supernormal rate in the early periods. After the supernormal growth period, the stock's dividend will grow at a normal growth rate. It can be explained by the fact that a business will mature in the long run, which will maintain a stable growth rate for its earnings. Alternatively, a matured business will be less likely to achieve a significant gain to raise the growth rate for dividends.","Dividend Discount Model (DDM): The dividend discount model can help investors to estimate the fair value of a common stock. Within this model, all dividends are carried back to the present, using the investor's expected rate of return as a discount rate."

With that being said, the current operation can be integrated with other firms from different business sectors, which can earn an advantage of synergy.
Dividends: Stocks from a corporation that pays higher dividends will be attractive to other firms with excess cash.
