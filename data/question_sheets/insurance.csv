She has collision insurance on her car with a $500 deductible.",Can Kristen collect both the negligent driver's insurer and her own insurer?,Explain how subrogation supports the principle of indemnity.,,,A,"a. In this case, Kristen has the right to recover the loss from the driver as well as her insurer. However, the amount recovered will be limited as $500 is deductible. If Kristen wants to collect the amount of loss from the driver, then she needs to provide her insurer the right to subrogate against the negligent driver who caused the collision. Her insurer company has the legal right to sue the irresponsible driver or the driver's insurance company for damages.
b. The principle of indemnity governs the insurance for property and the liabilities by stating that an insured should not earn profits from their losses. When the subrogation right is given up by the insured to their insurer, it means that the insurer can claim damages from the negligent person who caused an accident. This practice ensures that the insured person is not collecting the amount of damages twice for a particular damage or loss. The subrogation in this way supports the principle of indemnity. Also, if an insured claims for insurance as well as damages for the same loss occurred, then they would profit from it. This is avoided through subrogation.","Insurance Insurance is explained as a contract which helps a person or entity to get protection from the insurance company in the form of policy.

This is because the loss exposures fail to meet the criterion that ideally insurable exposures must be:,A large number of similar exposure units.,Definite and measurable.,Fortuitous.,Independent and not catastrophic.,D,"The correct option is:

Adverse selection would arise when there is asymmetric information between agents in health insurance markets. Potential customers who are sick are more willing to seek insurance. This will lead to an insurer getting a sicker customer base than the overall population. Healthy individuals might find the price too high and choose not to insure themselves. Sick individuals have a higher reservation price and the insurer may not know about their illness or lack of healthy living standards.","Insurance: In a market with perfect inflation, an insurance firm earns a profit but holding risk on behalf of its customers.

b) Disability Insurance (Social Security)
Disability insurance refers to the type of insurance when the individual has been prevented from working for income because of the disability. People can obtain disability insurance through the Social Security system, or they can purchase insurance from private insurance companies.
Unemployment insurance is not the correct option because this insurance is helpful for individuals who are not able to find a job and meet certain criteria.
Worker compensation is not the correct option because worker compensation is the amount of money paid to the worker for their services to the company.
Medicare is not the correct option because Medicare is a medical insurance plan to pay for medical bills for critical diseases.","Insurance: Insurance refers to the contract between parties when one party who pays a premium gets coverage at the time of unfortunate events as mentioned in the contract terms.

c. accrued expense. Accrued expense is an outlay that has occurred but has not yet been recorded or paid. The cost of insurance that has not yet expired is not a current expenditure but rather a prepaid one.","Insurance: Insurance is the coverage that covers illness, deaths, health, and other things.

c. when people at a greater risk want to be insured more.

In this form of insurance, people in more risky jobs try to seek insurance and are considered to have more knowledge and information than the insurance company. There are various reasons why people in risky jobs seek insurance, including the need to feel secure and protected in case something happens to them and to ensure that they are compensated in case something happens to them. In most cases, insurance companies restrain from insuring people in the high-risk business because they are required to pay higher insurance benefits.","Asymmetric Information: Asymmetric information can be defined as a situation in which one party to a given contract has more valuable and essential information than the other party.

Option B is incorrect because secondary reserves are liquid in nature and can be converted into cash quickly. They, too, can also be held as insurance.
