id,question,A,B,C,D,Answer,Explanation,Hint
1,Gain on Disposal of Equity Investments is a temporary equity account and is reported in the Other Income and (Expenses) section of the income statement.,True,False,,,B,"The statement is
b. False
. It is
false
because the gain on disposal of equity investments is
a revenue account
. Temporary equity accounts are accounts like dividends that are not reported on the income statement.
It is, however, true to say that the account is reported in the Other Income and (Expenses) section of the income statement because the gain on disposal on an investment is a realized gain that is reported in the income statement, not in other comprehensive income. Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale equity investments are recorded in other comprehensive income.",Gains on the Sale of Investments: The gain on the disposal of a long-term investment represents the difference between the cost of the investment and the proceeds received when it was sold. It is recorded using an accounting entry and it is therefore not included in the statement of cash flow.
2,The amount by which a firm's tax bill is reduced as a result of the depreciation expense is referred to as depreciation:,tax shield.,credit.,erosion.,opportunity cost.,A,"The correct answer is option
a. tax shield
.
The depreciation expense is a non-cash expense that reduces the net operating income before tax by a proportionate amount. This value itself represents the taxable income and hence the reduced taxable income also decreases the tax liability and tax payments. Thus, the amount by which the tax is reduced on account of depreciation expense is called tax shield.","Income Statement: An income statement is a financial statement that depicts the revenues, expenses, and income for a firm during a given year. It can be created by considering the single-step method or multi-step method."
3,Which of the following is true about an income statement?,It can be used to evaluate the past performance of the enterprise.,It is used to measure the liquidity of a company.,Income measurement does not involve judgment.,It is used to measure the solvency of a company.,A,"The correct option is
a. It can be used to evaluate the past performance of the enterprise.
An income statement, also called a profit and loss statement, is a financial statement that details a company's earnings for a given time period, usually a fiscal quarter or year. It is one of the most important financial statements for evaluating a company's financial health.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
b. It is used to measure the liquidity of a company. Option b is incorrect because the balance sheet, which details a company's assets, liabilities, and equity, is used to assess its liquidity, not the income statement.
c. Income measurement does not involve judgment. Since there is some element of judgment involved in calculating income, option c is incorrect. The numbers that appear on the income statement can change depending on the accounting methods and estimates used by the company.
d. It is used to measure the solvency of a company. The balance sheet, which details a company's assets and liabilities, is not only used to calculate the company's solvency, as Option D would have you believe. The term ""solvency"" refers to a company's ability to pay off its long-term debts, which is not reflected in the income statement.",Insolvency: Insolvency refers to the condition of a company or an individual when they do not have the ability to pay off their debts. The companies file with their respective legal authorities to inform them of their insolvency.
4,The term revenue can best be described as the:,cash received from selling goods and serving customers during a given accounting period.,selling price of goods and services rendered to customers during a given accounting period.,net increase in owners' equity during a given period.,bottom line in the income statement.,B,"The correct answer is
b. selling price of goods and services rendered to customers during a given accounting period.
Revenue is the top line of the income statement, It reflects the amount of goods and services rendered to customers during a given accounting period. All expenses of the given accounting period are subtracted from revenue to arrive at the net income.
Explanation for incorrect options
The cash received from selling goods and serving customers during a given accounting period is the cash collection from customers; hence option (a) is incorrect.
The net increase in owners' equity during a given period is the change in owner's equity; hence option (c) is incorrect.
The bottom line in the income statement is the net income; hence option (d) is incorrect,","Income Statement: The income statement of the financial statements along with the balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and the statement of changes in equity. The income statement shows all the revenue and expenses of the business for the given period."
5,A net loss will result during a time period when:,liabilities exceed assets,drawings exceed investments,expenses exceed revenues,revenues exceed expenses,C,"The correct answer is option
C. expenses exceed revenues
.
The net income of a firm is computed by subtracting the expenses from revenues for a given period. If the expenses are more than revenues, the net income value will be negative so it will be called a net loss. On the other hand, if the expenses are less than revenues, the net income will be positive so it will be called a net profit.
Liabilities cannot exceed assets for a firm because the assets represent a sum of owners' capital and liabilities. If drawings exceed investments, it is referred to as net cash outflows for a given period.","Financial Statements: There are three important financial statements of a firm, namely, income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. An income statement shows expenses, revenues, and net earnings. A balance sheet exhibits assets, liabilities, and owner's capital. A cash flow statement depicts cash inflows, cash outflows, and net cash flows."
6,The physical count of inventory was incorrect; it overstated the ending inventory. This would cause the,cost of goods sold to be overstated.,cost of goods sold to be understated.,gross profit to be understated.,net income to be understated.,D,"The correct answer is option B) cost of goods sold to be understated.
If the physical count of inventory was incorrect and overstated the ending inventory, it would have the following effects on the financial statements:
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): An overstated ending inventory would result in an understated COGS, as the calculation for COGS is: COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory. If the ending inventory is higher than it should be, the COGS will be lower than the actual amount. (Reason why Option A is incorrect and Option B is correct)
Gross Profit: An understated COGS would lead to an overstated gross profit, as the calculation for gross profit is: Gross Profit = Net Sales - COGS. If COGS is lower than the actual amount, the gross profit will appear higher than it should be. (Reason Option C is incorrect)
Net Income: As the gross profit is overstated, it will also result in an overstated net income, assuming no other income and expenses change. Higher net income could potentially mislead investors and stakeholders regarding the company's actual profitability. (Reason Option D is incorrect)
Therefore,the correct answer is option
B) cost of goods sold to be understated.","Income Statement: In accounting, the income statement is a financial report created by the management to show how much profit or loss the company earned during an accounting period."
7,Revenue minus expenditure equal:,Total cost.,Total sales.,Total turnover.,None of the above.,D,"The correct answer is option d. None of the above.
Revenue minus expenditure equals a business's net income (or net loss), also known as the bottom line or profit/loss.
Revenue is the total amount earned from selling goods or services, while expenditure is the money a business spends to generate revenue. Expenditure includes salaries, rent, utilities, supplies, and other costs related to the company's operation.
Subtracting expenditure from revenue gives the net business income or a net loss. If revenue is greater than expenditure, the business has earned a profit; if the expenditure is greater than revenue, the business has incurred a loss. The net income or net loss measures the business's financial performance over a specific period.
Options such as total cost, total sales, and total turnover are other financial metrics used to measure a business's financial performance, hence incorrect are not directly related to revenue minus expenditure. Total cost is the money a business spends to produce and sell a product or service. In contrast, total sales refer to the money a business earns from selling products or services. Total turnover refers to the total amount of money a business earns from its activities.
Therefore,
the answer is (d) None of the above.","Income Statement: The income statement is a crucial financial statement that provides insights into a company's financial performance over a specific period. It is used by investors, creditors, and other stakeholders to evaluate a company's profitability and financial health and to make informed decisions about investing in or lending to the company."
8,What is gross profit for a merchandiser calculated as?,Net sales minus cost of goods sold.,Gross sales minus cost of goods sold.,Net sales minus merchandise inventory.,Gross sales minus merchandise inventory.,A,"The correct answer is option
a. Net sales minus cost of goods sold.
The gross profit for a firm is ascertained by subtracting the cost of goods sold during a given period from the net sales revenue.
The net sales figure is computed by deducting the returns, sale discounts, and allowances from the gross sales revenue. On the other hand, the cost of goods sold represents the total cost incurred to manufacture the quantum of goods sold during the period.","Income Statement: An income statement is a financial statement that depicts the gross earnings, expenses, and net earnings for a given year. If it is prepared by considering the multi-step method, different tiers of income such as gross profit, operating income, earnings before taxes, and net income are shown."
9,Consider the following item and identify the category in which it should appear in a multi-step income statement: Depreciation expense - Store equipment.,Revenue from Sales,Selling Expenses,Administrative Expense,Other Income,B,"The depreciation expense for store equipment must be categorized under
b. Selling Expenses
because:
It is an expense item, so it cannot be categorized as revenue from sales or other revenue.
It is incurred in selling the company's products, not in its administrative office.
It is an operating expense, and cannot be classified under other expenses like interest paid or loss on the sale of an asset.","Multi-Step Income Statement: Most income statements for external use are prepared using the multi-step format because it presents the gross profit, operating income, and net income from continuing operations as line items. These items are used to calculate various financial ratios."
10,Where is interest expense listed on the income statement?,Other expense section,Cost of merchandise sold,Operating expense,"Interest expense is listed on the balance sheet, not the income statement",A,"The correct answer is
A) Other expense section
.
Options
Analysis
A. Other expense section
The other expense section includes various expenses that are not directly related to the company's primary operations. These expenses may consist of interest expenses and losses from an asset sale.
B. Cost of merchandise sold
Cost of merchandise sold refers to the amount incurred by a company to acquire or produce the goods it will sell to the customers. It is reported separately on the income statement.
C. Operating expense
Interest is a non-operating expense and will not be reported under the operating expenses.
D. Interest expense is listed on the balance sheet, not the income statement
Interest expense is not a balance sheet item and is found on the income statement.","Income Statement: An income statement calculates and reports the money a company makes and spends during a specific period, usually a month, a quarter, or a year. It lists the company's revenue and subtracts its expenses to determine its net income or profit."
11,Consider the following item and identify the category in which it should appear in a multi-step income statement: Office Salaries.,Revenue from Sales,Selling Expenses,Administrative Expense,Other Income,C,"Office Salaries should appear in the
c. Administrative Expense
category on the income statement.
It is an administrative expense because it relates to the office, not the factory or the salaries of sales staff.
It is an expense item so it should not appear in any revenue category.
Other income and expenses are used to present gains, losses, and expenses that are not incurred in the operations of the company, like interest received and paid and the gain on the sale of an asset.","Multi-Step Income Statement: The multi-step format of the income statement differs from the single-step format because operation and nonoperating items are separated, and in the operating section, product and period costs are separated."
12,Gross margin is the difference between sales revenue and cost of goods sold.,True,False,,,A,"The correct answer is option a. True.
Gross margin, gross profit margin, or simply gross profit, is the difference between sales revenue and the cost of goods sold (COGS). It represents the money a business has left over after accounting for the direct costs of producing or purchasing the goods or services it sells. Gross margin is an important financial metric used to assess a company's profitability and efficiency in managing its production or inventory costs.
The gross margin can be expressed as a monetary value (gross profit) or a percentage of sales revenue (gross profit margin). To calculate the gross margin percentage, divide the gross profit by the sales revenue and multiply by 100:
{eq}\begin{align} \text{Gross Margin Percentage} &= \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Sales Revenue}} \\ \end{align} {/eq}
A higher gross margin may mean that a company effectively manages its production or inventory costs and generates more profit for each dollar of revenue.
Accordingly,
the correct answer is option a. True.","Income Statement: An income statement, also known as a profit and loss statement or P&L, is a financial statement used in accounting that details the sales and costs incurred by a firm for a given time period, usually a quarter or a year."
13,What are the major elements of an Income Statement?,"Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold, Selling Expenses, General Expenses","Revenues, Expenses, Gains, Losses",,,B,"The correct answer is
B. Revenues, Expenses, Gains, Losses
.
The four major elements of an income statement include revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. Similarly, the three major elements of a balance sheet include liabilities, equity, and assets.
Option A (Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold, Selling Expenses, General Expenses) is not correct. Revenue, cost of goods sold, general expenses, and selling expenses are a part of the income statement, but not its elements. These items fall under the revenue element and expense elements.","Financial Statements: A company's yearly financial performance can be interpreted by its income statement, which reports the net profit or loss made during the accounting period. A company's financial performance contributes to its financial status and cash position."
14,Multiple-step income statements show:,gross profit but not net income.,neither gross profit nor net income.,gross profit but not the cost of merchandise sold.,"gross profit, cost of merchandise sold, income from operations, and net income.",D,"The correct answer is option d. gross profit, cost of merchandise sold, income from operations, and net income.

A multiple-step income statement separates operating revenues and operating expenses from non-operating revenues, non-operating expenses, gains, and losses. It provides more detailed information and insights into a company's financial performance compared to a single-step income statement. This statement typically includes gross profit, cost of merchandise sold, income from operations, and net income.","Income Statement: In accounting, income statements can be used to compare financial performance across different periods, identifying trends, growth, and areas to improve."
15,Where are selling and administrative expenses found on the multi-step income statement?,Before gross profit,After-sales and before gross profit,After net income and before expenses,After gross profit,D,"The correct answer is option d. After gross profit.

16,Which financial statement would contain the following account balance: Depreciation expense?,Balance Sheet,Income Statement,Statement of Owners' Equity,,B,"The correct answer is
b. Income Statement
.
Answer Options
Explanation
a. Balance Sheet
The balance sheet reports an Accumulated Depreciation account balance, a contra-asset account.
b. Income Statement
Depreciation results from writing down the capital expenditure on a fixed asset to a revenue expense. It is debited to the income statement through an adjustment.
c. Statement of Owners' Equity
Depreciation expense has no direct impact on this statement.","Nominal Accounts: Nominal accounts are always reported on the income statement. They can never be found on the balance sheet. The other two types of accounts are personal and real. Real accounts are always reported on the balance sheet, unlike nominal accounts."
17,An analysis in which all the components of an income statement are expressed as a percentage of net sales is called:,vertical analysis.,horizontal analysis.,liquidity analysis.,common-size analysis.,A,"An analysis in which all the components of an income statement are expressed as a percentage of net sales is called
a. vertical analysis
The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
a. vertical analysis.
This is the correct alternative. In vertical analysis, each line item in the financial statement is expressed as a percentage of the base amount. In the income statement, this base amount is net sales and in the balance sheet, the base amount is total assets.
b. horizontal analysis.
In horizontal analysis, the changes between the current and prior periods are expressed as percentages.
c. liquidity analysis.
Liquidity analysis is the study of a company's cash flow using ratios like the current and quick ratios.
d. common-size analysis
A common-size analysis is an analysis where the current results are compared. It includes vertical and horizontal analysis and can also include comparisons with other companies.",Income Statement: The statement prepared by qualified and skilled individuals in a business to estimate the net earnings made is called the income statement. The income statement is put together before composing the balance sheet.
18,"On a multiple-step income statement, Income from Operations is computed as follows:",net sales less cost of goods soldb. cost of goods sold less total assetsc. operating expenses plus total assetsd. gross profit less total operating expenses,,,,D,"On a multiple-step income statement, Income from Operations is computed as
(d.) gross profit less total operating expenses
.
On the income statement, 'Income from Operations' is the line item right after the operating expenses (selling and administrative expenses) have been deducted from the gross profit) and before the non-operating items like interest and gains or losses on the sale of assets are deducted or added. It also excludes income tax.
The table provides reasons why the other options are incorrect:
a. net sales less cost of goods sold
This formula calculates the gross profit, not income from operations.
b. cost of goods sold less total assets
Total assets are calculated on the balance sheet and income from operations in the income statement.
c. operating expenses plus total assets
Again, total assets are not used to calculate any income statement line item",Income from Operations: The income from operations (rather than the net income) is used in several financial ratio formulas. It is therefore presented separately as a line item on the income statement when the statement is prepared in the multi-step format.
19,"At the start of the year, Northern Lights had $8,000 worth of merchandise. What do we know about Northern Lights?",It's a service business.,It's a retail business.,The company ended with a net income last year.,The company ended with a net loss last year.,B,"The correct answer is option
B) It's a retail business.
Since Northern Lights had $8,000 worth of merchandise, we can infer that it is a retail business that sells merchandise or goods to customers. On the other hand, a service business sells services like consulting services or advisory services so it cannot have merchandise inventory.
We cannot comment on Northern Lights' net income or net loss for the last year as we don't have information about the revenue and expenses.","Income Statement: The gross earnings or revenue, different kinds of expenses, and net earnings of a firm in a given year are reported on the income statement. It can be prepared by considering the single-step method or multi-step method."
20,Prepare profit and loss accounts for Maria's Delicatessen. The following data are relevant for the first year of operation.,"Sales amount to pounds 243,000, and the company estimated 30% gross profit.","Wages for the year amount to pounds 48,000, and general expenses for the year are estimated at pounds 15,000.","The company spent pounds 12,000 on promotional activities.",,A,"To answer this problem, let us first compute the significant components in the profit and loss statement.
a. Sales amount to pounds 243,000, and the company estimated 30% gross profit.
If the sales revenue amounted to 243,000 pounds and it was estimated that 30% is the gross profit component, then the cost of goods sold is equivalent to the following.
Cost of Goods Sold = Sales Revenue * (100% - Gross Profit Rate)
Cost of Goods Sold = 243,000 pounds * (100% - 30%)
Cost of Goods Sold = 243,000 pounds * 70%
Cost of Goods Sold = 170,100 pounds
So, the cost of goods sold is equivalent to 170,100 pounds.
b. Wages for the year amount to pounds 48,000, and general expenses for the year are estimated at pounds 15,000.
48,000 pounds for wages must be accounted for as operational expenses. Total general expenses are equivalent to 15,000 pounds.
c. The company spent pounds 12,000 on promotional activities.
12,000 pounds of promotional activities are considered part of the total marketing and advertising expenses which is an operating expense also.
We can now create the profit and loss statement as follows.

The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
A. separate line item called other revenues and expenses.
No, other revenues and expenses include items like the gains and losses from the sale of property, plant, and equipment, but not discontinued operations.
B. part of regular income from operations for the period.
No, discontinued operations are presented separately on the face of the income statement.
C. separate line item before taxes.
No, the revenues, gains, expenses, and losses from continued operations are presented before tax.
D. separate line item net of taxes.
This is the correct alternative. The results of discontinued operations are reported at the bottom of the income statement, after the net income from continued operations, and they are presented net of income tax.","Discontinued Operations: In financial accounting, discontinued operations refer to a business component that a company has sold or that it is in the process of selling. To make the financial statements useful, discontinues operations are disclosed in the statements."
22,What is subtracted from the Gross Revenue to calculate the Net Income on the Income Statement?,Cost of Goods Sold,Expenses,Current Liabilities,,A,"Correct Answer:
Option a. Cost of Goods Sold
.
The income statement computations flow in the following order:
Gross profit = Sales - Cost of goods sold
This computation is followed by:
Operating income = Gross profit - Operating expenses
This computation is followed by:
Net income = Operating income - Non-operating expenses
As per the sequence, the cost of goods sold should be deducted from the gross sales before adjusting expenses.","Financial Statements: Financial statements of a company primarily include the profit and loss account, statement of financial position, and cash position statement. A profit and loss account can also be called an income statement."
23,What part of an income statement is the firm's profit from core businesses?,Net income,Gross profit,Operating profit,Income after interest but before taxes,C,"The correct option is C. Operating profit.
The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
A. Net income
Net income includes various non-core items like the results of discontinued operations, interest, and income tax.
B. Gross profit
Gross profit excludes operating expenses.
C. Operating profit
This is the correct alternative. Operating income is the gross profit minus operating expenses. It excludes nonoperating items like gains and losses on the sale of assets and interest
.
D. Income after interest but before taxes
The interest expense is not an operating expense for most companies, and the income after interest is usually calculated after other nonoperating items like gains and losses are taken into account.",Income Statement: The income statement is included in all sets of published financial statements and it is almost always prepared using the multistep format. This means that operating and nonoperating items are separated and product and period costs are presented separately.
24,Which financial statement would contain the following account balance: Interest revenue?,Balance Sheet,Income Statement,Statement of Owners' Equity,,B,"The correct answer is
b. Income Statement
.
Answer Options
Explanation
a. Balance Sheet
Interest revenue is not reported on the balance sheet. However, accrued interest will definitely be on the balance sheet.
b. Income Statement
Any income, apart from sales revenue, is a part of the income statement. Interest revenue is a non-operating revenue for the business, credited to the income statement.
c. Statement of Owners' Equity
Interest revenue impacts the net income, which has a direct impact on this statement.","Interest: Interest becomes an obligation when payable on the borrowed amount, but an asset when receivable from the borrower on the amount lent. If the current period interest is not paid or received, accrual is necessary through an adjusting entry at the accounting year-end."
25,The percentage of change in total assets between two balance sheet dates is an example of:,vertical analysis,horizontal analysis,capital analysis,profitability analysis,B,"The correct answer is
option B) Horizontal analysis
The horizontal analysis involves comparing the financial statement or financial positions for more than one period side by side. Usually, analysts identify the trends of current assets and noncurrent assets, also known as trend-based analysis. An analyst can identify the increase or decrease in assets, and then other useful decisions can be made. It helps in forecasting. The horizontal analysis aids in determining the financial position and detecting modifications that need to be made.
The explanation for incorrect options:
A). Vertical analysis or common-size analysis helps in identifying each item of the balance sheet as a percentage of the balance sheet's total assets.
C). Capital analysis is the financial technique that focuses on a company's capital structure, such as debt and equity.
D). Profitability analysis refers to the financial technique that evaluates the ability to generate profits from the operations of the company.","Balance Sheet: The balance sheet represents the financial position or statement of financial position of the company for a given point in time.

Which of the following statements correctly states the effect of the error?,Net income is understated.,Net income is overstated.,Cost of merchandise sold is understated.,Merchandise inventory reported on the balance sheet is overstated.,A,"The correct answer is option
a. Net income is understated
.
The merchandise inventory at the end of a given year is inversely related to the cost of merchandise sold. Thus, if the inventory is understated, the cost of merchandise sold will be overstated. The net income for the year is inversely related to the cost of merchandise sold. An overstatement in the cost of merchandise sold will lead to an understatement of the net income.","Income Statement: An income statement is a financial statement that depicts the sales revenue, expenses, and net earnings of a firm in a given year.

b. Incorrect. Operating income and EBIT are indifferent.
c. Correct. Earnings before tax (EBT) is a remainder of revenue after all operating expenses and financing expenses. Hence, it is an appropriate base to estimate the firm's income tax liability.

a. reports the changes in assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity over a period of time: This option is incorrect. A company's income statement does not involve changes in permanents accounts as mentioned in the said option.
b. reports the assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity at a specific date: This option is incorrect. This statement refers to a balance sheet, not an income statement.
c. presents the revenues and expenses for a specific period of time: This is the correct answer. An income statement shows all company revenues, expenses, and profit at a given time.
d. summarizes the changes in retained earnings for a specific period of time: This option is incorrect. This statement refers to the statement of changes in retained earnings, not an income statement.

30,"Extraordinary items are both usual and interesting in nature. Extraordinary items appear on the income statement (net-of-tax effect) as part of ""Income from continuing operations"".",True,False,,,B,"b. False
It is false to say that extraordinary items appear on the income statement (net-of-tax effect) as part of ""Income from continuing operations"".
It is no longer the practice to break out extraordinary items on the income statement from ""Income from continuing operations."" The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) did away with the concept of extraordinary items in their 2015 set of accounting standards. Current accounting standards do not define extraordinary items to include rare or one-off occurrences. Instead, these items, depending on their nature and materiality, are either included in ""Income from continuing operations"" or disclosed separately in the financial statements. Since extraordinary items are neither common nor noteworthy, they are not presented in the income statement as a separate line item.","Income Statement: The income statement, or profit and loss statement, is one of the three major financial reports that companies make periodically to determine how much their profit or loss is in a particular time period."

. Both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence.
An extraordinary item is considered outside the ordinary activities of a company's operations and is typically not projected to repeat in the foreseeable future.
Extraordinary items are extremely rare and outside of a company's ordinary course of business, while special items are less rare but still outside of a company's normal operations. Both are reported separately in financial statements to provide transparency and clarity to investors and analysts.
