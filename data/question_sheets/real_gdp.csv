1,"The table below contains data for the country of Batterland, which produces only waffles and pancakes. The base year is 2013.","$ 320,",$440,$760,$770,C,"The correct answer is
Option C) $760
.
Real GDP indicates the total value created during a year through producing and providing goods and services, particularly at constant prices.
In the given scenario, 2013 is the base year. Therefore, we will use the prices of 2013 for the quantities generated in 2011 to determine the real GDP in 2011.
{eq}\begin{align*} \text{Real GDP in 2011} &= \text{(Quantity of Waffles in 2011 × Price of Waffles in 2013) + (Quantity of Pancakes in 2011 × Price of Pancakes in 2013)} \\ &= \rm {(100\,units × \$4) + (120\,units × \$3)} \\ &= \$400 + \$360\\ &= \$760 \end{align*} {/eq}","Factors Contributing to GDP: Factors contributing to GDP include government spending, consumer spending, business investment, and net exports. When these factors increase, GDP tends to grow as well. Per Capita GDP is calculated using the GDP and a country's total population, and it is a measure of the average economic output per person."
2,"If a man marries his hired housekeeper, the value of GDP:",rises,"falls, but the value of national income rises","rises, but the value of national income falls",falls,D,"The correct option is
d. Falls
.
We know that the GDP measures the monetary worth of all the furnished services and products that a country produces in a given period. In this case, the man marries the hired housekeeper, the housekeeper now becomes his wife; therefore, he will not pay her now for the domestic services done by her. So the value of GDP declines.","Income: In economics, income is the sum of money that a person can earn by supplying his/her labor services at a given period. There are other sources of income like interest rate, rent received, et cetera."
3,Household production and the underground economy:,Is irrelevant because it constitutes only a very small fraction of GDP for  most countries,Are important but unaccounted for in the commerce Department's estimate of GDP,Are not considered formal production of goods and services therefore are not included in GDP accounting,Are fully accounted for in GDP figures gathered by the commerce department,B,"The correct option is
B. Are important but unaccounted for in the Commerce Department's estimate of GDP
.
The production made by households for mutual help and the unaccounted/illegal production of services are products are not included while estimating the GDP as the data is not available regarding these services. Furthermore, these services and products are hidden to be estimated.  Hence, both the household production and underground economy are crucial but unaccounted for by the Commerce Department while estimating the GDP of a nation.","Household: The household is considered as one of the production factors that helps a nation to produce its final services and products by rendering its labor services at an existing wage rate. Thus, the household comprises labor services in an economy."
4,"Suppose that a country's GDP rises from $5000 to $8000 and over the same period, prices have risen by 50%. In this case, real GDP has",risen.,fallen.,stayed the same.,"risen, then fallen over the period.",B,"The correct answer choice is
B. fallen
Determine the percentage change in the country's GDP as below:
{eq}\begin{aligned}   \%\text{ change in GDP}&=\frac{\text{Initial GDP}-\text{New GDP}}{\text{Initial GDP}}\times 100 \\   &=\frac{\$8,000-\$5,000}{\$8,000}\times 100 \\   &=37.5  \end{aligned}

{/eq}
The increase in nominal GPP is 37.5% while the price by 50%. Since the real GDP equals the nominal GDP divided by the price level, a higher increase in prices relative to the nominal GDP implies a fall in the real GDP.
Additional information:
A. The real GDP will decrease and not increase. As such, the option is incorrect.
C. Since the percentage change in nominal GDP and the price level are not the same, the real GDP will change rather than stay the same. As such, the option is incorrect.
D. The real GDP will not rise since the prices increase more than the nominal GDP. This makes the option choice incorrect.","Real GDP vs Nominal GDP: The GDP or the gross domestic product can be defined as the money value of all the final goods and services that are produced domestically by a country during a given fiscal year. When one talks about the nominal GDP of a particular year, it implies the value of all final goods and services produced during that year measured at the price level of that year only. On the other hand, the real GDP  for a given year is estimated by measuring the value of that year's products based on the price level in the base year."
5,"If spending exceeds output, real GDP will decline as firms cut back on production.",True,False,,,B,"In Economics, spending is another term for Consumption, and it is one of the major components of GDP. Effectively spending is the product of output (quantity) and its prices, and this is called Nominal GDP.  So, when spending exceeds output, it means spending (Nominal GDP) increases due to an increase in prices. Higher prices will encourage firms to produce more since at higher prices they are more likely to make profits. Thus, the given statement is
b.false.","Real GDP Real GDP refers to the market value of domestically produced goods and services after controlling for the changes in prices. Mathematically, Real GDP is given as: {eq}Real \ GDP = Quantity \ in \ the \ current  \ year \times Prices \ in \ the \ base \ year (price  \  held \ constant)

7,Which of the following accurately characterizes the distribution of real GDP per capita internationally?,Real GDP per capita is relatively uniform across countries.,Real GDP per capita varies greatly across countries.,The disparity between wealthy countries and poor countries in real GDP per person has become smaller over the last 1000 years.,Why some countries develop more quickly than others is a complete mystery.,B,"The correct option is
B) The real GDP per capita varies greatly across countries.
Every country has different resources, supply, demand, and economic and political conditions. These factors decide the GDP of the country. The country must have rich resources and political intent to boost its GDP and, hence, its real GDP per capita. So real GDP per capita varies greatly across countries. The per capita GDP of America is far different than that of India.
The reason for wrong options.
a) The GDP is never uniform and ever-changing.
c) The GDP gap has increased in the past 1000 years.
d) There is no mystery because some countries have rich natural resources and political intent.","Gross Domestic Product: Gross domestic product is the monetary outcome of the production activities in the country for a period. A developed country has higher economic activities and, hence, a higher GDP."
8,Suppose you are given the following data:,"Less than $400,000","Between $400,000 and $550,000","Between $550,000 and $700,000","Between $700,000 and $850,000",C,"The correct option is
Option (c.)
.
The GDP deflator can be calculated by taking the ratio between the nominal and real GDP and then multiplying it by 100. It can be denoted as:
{eq}{\rm\ GDP}\,{\rm\ Deflator}\,{\rm\  = }\,\dfrac{{{\rm\ Nominal}\,{\rm\ GDP}}}{{{\rm\ Real}\,{\rm\ GDP}}}{\rm{ \times 100}}

{/eq}
The given value of nominal GDP is $700,000, and the value of the GDP deflator is 120. Thus, the real GDP can be calculated as follows:
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\ GDP}\,{\rm\ Deflator}\,&{\rm\ = }\,\dfrac{{{\rm\ Nominal}\,{\rm\ GDP}}}{{{\rm\ Real}\,{\rm\ GDP}}}{\rm{ \times 100}}\\

&{\rm\ 120 = }\dfrac{{{\rm\ 700,000}}}{{{\rm\ Real}\,{\rm\ GDP}}}{\rm{ \times 100}}\\

{\rm\ Real}\,&{\rm\ GDP = }\dfrac{{{\rm\ 700,000}}}{{{\rm\ 120}}}{\rm{ \times 100}}\\

&= 583,333.333

\end{align*}

{/eq}
Thus, the real GDP for 2013 is $583,333.333
.
Reasons for incorrect options are
Option (a.)
The value of real GDP, as calculated by the formula of GDP deflator, is found to be $583,333.333, which is greater than $400,000.
Option (b.)
The real GDP from the calculation does not fall between $400,000 and $550,000.
Option (d.)
The real GDP calculated is the ratio between the nominal GDP and the GDP deflator, which is found to be $583,333.333 and is not within the given range.

{/eq}"
10,The long-term increase in the real GDP is called:,Economic growth.,Business cycles.,Economic progress.,Technological progress.,A,"The correct option is
a). Economic growth.
The fact that the GDP is rising means that production and consumption activity in the economy are increasing. So overall, this is economic growth because consumption is the ultimate activity of economic activities. Due to higher production, the unemployment rate is also low, and the majority of people have purchasing power in the economy.
The explanation for other options
Option b is not correct because ups and down the economy is a business cycle
Option c is not correct because economic progress only compares the production activity.
Option d is not correct because technological progress is an enhancement in technology.","Real GDP: The real gross domestic product is the monetary value of the produced goods and services in the economy and is also adjusted for inflation. Higher real GDP is better for any economy, and it indicates economic prosperity."
11,GDP is an important indicator because it is used as a measure of all of the following except,environmental quality.,average living standards.,economic growth.,business-cycle fluctuations.,A,"The correct answer is option a - environmental quality.
a.
The option is true. Environmental quality is not considered a part of GDP. The reason is, environmental quality does not mean it adds to the total amount of commodities that are produced in the economy. Environmental quality does not mean that it will add up as a part of GDP as it does not produce any output to the economy.
b.
GDP is considered to be the market value of all finished commodities that are produced in an economy. Therefore, GDP does not measure the average standard of living. Hence, it is an incorrect option.
c.
The option is false as GDP ensures the amount of economic growth in the economy. The reason being when the GDP increases the economic growth of the economy also increases.
d.
The option is not true as GDP is an important indicator for fluctuations in the business cycle. GDP indicates whether an economy is going through inflation, recession, or depression.
e.
The option is false. GDP refers to the market value of commodities that are produced in an economy during a particular period. GDP does not measure the average income of households.","Economic Growth Economic growth refers to the rise in the production of commodities in a country during a given period.  Thus, it is measured by the aggregate value of the commodities that is measured by the GDP of the country."
12,Individuals live and work as both individual and aggregate economic entities.,True,False,,,A,"The correct answer is a-
True.
The individual production that occurs in the economy is a part of the individual supply and is a part of the aggregate supply. Thus, it can be said that the output produced by an individual supplier becomes a part of the aggregate entities. Another example is the combination of the individual demand makes the market demand which is also a part of the aggregate measure.","Economic Inputs In a free-market economy, there are various inputs that are required to produce a certain level of output. Some of the inputs required to produce a certain level of output are land, labor, and capital."
13,Which of the following is a shortcoming of GDP?,it excludes changes in inventories,it includes an estimate of illegal transactions,it excludes quality of products,it includes business investment spending,C,"The answer is
c, it excludes quality of products
. It is correct to say that GDP is an imperfect macroeconomic indicator. GDP only captures spending on newly created goods and services within a certain period of time. GDP can not capture changes in the quality of the goods and services purchased. Sometimes quality improvements cause more spending and higher prices, while other times the economy creates higher quality products at lower prices and causes less spending. For example, modern cars can drive more miles than older cars, which means households might purchase a new car less frequently than they had in prior years. Alternatively, clothing might be produced at a lower quality causing consumers to purchase clothing more frequently. GDP can not capture these quality differences, only the quanties of goods and services purchased by domestic households, firms, governments and foreigners.
Answers A and D, refer the part of GDP captured by spending by private businesses. This part of GDP is referred to as investment and is not a shortcoming of GDP calculation. Most countries do not include an estimate of illegal transactions (also called black market spending) in their GDP, which is not a shortcoming.","Macroeconomics: Macroeconomics is a social science that seeks to answer questions about the overall performance of an economy, usually a country. Typically, questions are answered using either positive economic statements or normative economic statements. Positive economic statements or answers are given just as facts or data. Positive statements are not debated, whereas normative economic statements are given with some sort of opinion or philosophy. Normative statements and answers can and are debated by economists and policymakers. Often a normative statement will have a ""should"" or ""would improve"" in the answer. Both types of answers are helpful to creating monetary and fiscal policies for countries."
14,Comparing real GDP between two consecutive years is most useful in determining which economic measurement?,equilibrium price,equity,economic growth,exchange rates,C,"The best answer is c.
Comparing real GDP between two consecutive years is most useful in determining which economic measurement?
a. equilibrium price
No, the equilibrium price results from the interaction of supply and demand in a market.
b. equity
No, equity means the value of shares of stock issued by a company.
c. economic growth
Yes, this is the best answer. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures economic growth after adjusting for inflation.
d. exchange rates
No, exchange rates determine the relative value of different currencies.",Real GDP: Real GDP is short for real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Gross Domestic Product measures the economic output of an economy over time. Real GDP means the inflation value has been adjusted out of the number.
15,Which of the following is most commonly used to monitor short-run changes in economic activity?,The inflation rate.,Real GDP.,Aggregate demand.,Aggregate supply.,B,"Option B, Real GDP
is correct.
Real GDP is measured as the total value of goods and services produced in an economy. Real GDP is adjusted for inflation and monitors short-run changes in economic activity. It measures how the economy is performing in the short term.
Option A: The inflation rate is the rate at which the price of goods increases over a period of time. Hence, option A is wrong.
Option C: Aggregate demand measures the total demand for goods produced in an economy. It consists of consumer goods, exports, imports, etc., and does not monitor deviations in the short term. Hence, option C is wrong.
Option D: Aggregate supply is the total quantity produced by producers in a given period at a given price. Aggregate supply has a positive correlation with the price level and aggregate supply. Hence, option D is wrong.","Economic Fluctuations: Economic fluctuations are determined by business cycles. During a recession, output falls, unemployment increases, and central banks decrease interest rates to bring the economy back on track. At their peak, output and employment surged, followed by a surge in interest rates."
16,"Consider an economy that produces only DVDs and DVD players.

17,GDP measured from the expenditure side include(s):,Tax payments,Spending on capital goods,Purchases of public goods and services,Foreign spending on American output,A,"GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of the total value of goods and services produced in an economy. It can be measured in two ways: from the expenditure side and from the production side. When GDP is measured from the expenditure side, it includes the total spending on goods and services by households, businesses, and governments, as well as spending by foreigners on American-produced goods and services. This includes consumer spending on goods and services, investment in capital goods such as machinery and equipment, government spending on public goods and services, and exports. It does not include tax payments, as taxes are not considered a form of expenditure. So, the correct answers are:
b. Spending on capital goods
c. Purchases of public goods and services
d. Foreign spending on American output","Macroeconomics: Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole, rather than individual markets or households.

19,,Real GDP fell in Zorn.,Population fell in Alta.,Population growth reduced Alta's real GDP growth.,Alta's real GDP grew more rapidly than Zorn's real GDP.,D,"The correct answer is
d. Alta's real GDP grew more rapidly than Zorn's real GDP
.
The real GDP growth of Alta is $100, from $2,100 to $2,200 between years 2 and 3.
{eq}\begin{align*} \therefore \text{The rate of growth of real GDP for Alta between years 2 and 3 }&= \dfrac{\text{year 3 GDP }-\text{year 2 GDP}}{\text{year 2 GDP}} \\ &=\dfrac{2,200-2,100}{2,100} \\ &=\dfrac{100}{2,100} \\ &=0.0476\\ &=4.76\% \end{align*} {/eq}
The real GDP growth of Zorn is $2,000, from $152,000 to $154,000 between years 2 and 3.
{eq}\begin{align*} \therefore \text{The rate of growth of real GDP for Zorn between years 2 and 3 }&= \dfrac{\text{year 3 GDP }-\text{year 2 GDP}}{\text{year 2 GDP}} \\ &=\dfrac{154,000-152,000}{152,000} \\ &=\dfrac{2,000}{152,000} \\ &=0.0132 \\ &= 1.32\% \end{align*} {/eq}
Since 4.76% represents a greater growth rate as compared to 1.35%, Alta's real GDP grew more rapidly than Zorn's real GDP between the years 2 and 3.
The real GDP of Zorn increased from $152,000 to $154,000 between years 2 and 3, as seen in the given table. So, the real GDP did not fall in Zorn between years 2 and 3, and hence answer option a. is incorrect.
The population in Alta increased from 202 in year 2 to 210 in year 3, as seen in the given table. So, the population did not fall in Alta between years 2 and 3, and hence answer option b. is incorrect.
The population growth in Alta is 2, from 200 to 202 between years 1 and 2 and it is 8, from 202 to 210 between years 2 and 3. Thus, there is an increase in the population growth of Alta between years 2 and 3 as compared to the previous period. The real GDP growth of Alta is $100, from $2,000 to $2,100 between years 1 and 2 and it is $100, from $2,100 to $2,200 between years 2 and 3. Thus, there is no change in the real GDP growth of Alta between years 2 and 3 as compared to the previous period. Therefore, although there is population growth in Alta between years 2 and 3, there has been no reduction in its real GDP growth during this period. Hence, answer option c. is incorrect.","Real GDP: Real Gross Domestic Product (Real GDP) is a measure of the total value, adjusted for changes in price levels, i.e., inflation or deflation, of all final goods and services produced within an economy over a specific period."

22,What is the difference between nominal GDP and real GDP?,Real GDP includes used goods and services,Real GDP is adjusted for inflation,Nominal GDP is adjusted  for inflation,There is no difference,B,"The correct answer choice is
B. Real GDP is adjusted for inflation
Nominal GDP is defined as the value of all final commodities and the services that an economy produces during any given period of time (usually an year). Nominal GDP is determined as the price level in the economy times the quantity of final commodities and services produced in the year. The real GDP, on the other hand, is the value of all the final commodities and services adjusted for the changes in the price level (also termed as inflation). The real GDP determines the increase in GDP that has happened owing to an increase in the production of output and not because of the changes in the price level.
A. The option is incorrect since neither the nominal GDP nor the real GDP includes the used goods.
C. The option is incorrect since the real GDP in inflation adjusted rather than the nominal GDP.
D. The option is not a correct answer choice since the real GDP is a different concept from the Nominal GDP.",Defining GDP: GDP is an abbreviation for the Gross domestic product of the economy. The GDP is a measure of the economic growth of a country and includes the value of the final goods and services produced in the economy. A higher GDP implies increased economic growth while a decreased GDP implies restrained growth.
23,"If an economy has sticky prices and demand unexpectedly increases, you would expect the economy's real GDP to:",Increase.,Decrease.,Remain the same.,,A,"The correct option is
a. Increase
.
If an economy has sticky prices, it means the price tends to remain at the same level or change slowly, irrespective of the change in the cost of producing and selling products and services. Therefore, in an economy, when the economy has sticky prices and an unexpected increase in the demand causes the real GDP to rise by keeping the inflation rate stable.","Demand: In economics, demand refers to the units of a product or service that a buyer is willing and able to buy at each price level. Usually, as the price declines, the quantity demanded by buyers will rise, and another way around."
24,Policies aimed to reduce the level of GDP are called:,stabilization policiesB. policies with inside lagsC. contractionary policiesD. expansionary policies,,,,C,"Policies aimed to reduce the level of GDP are called
(C) Contractionary policies
.
Contractionary policies refer to macroeconomic policies that are aimed to slow down economic activities and control inflationary pressure. To control the inflationary pressure, the government and the central bank take action by increasing the interest rate, increasing government spending, and raising tax rates. When the tax rates and the interest rate are higher, the customer's purchasing power is reduced, and they purchase less. This demotivates the production and supply of products and services, resulting in lower economic activity.
The other options are incorrect:
A. stabilization policies
is not correct because stabilization policies are used to stabilize the economies from fluctuations in economic activity.
B. policies with inside lags
is not correct because inside lag shows only the time the policies show actual results.
D. expansionary policies
is not correct because they are the opposite of contractionary policies and are used to expand economic activities.","Federal Reserve Bank: The Federal Reserve Bank (the Fed) has the right to issue monetary policies to control inflation and unemployment. It is an independent institution that, in theory, is not influenced by political pressure."
25,"Answer true or false. Explain your answer. If the U.S. government reports that GDP in the third quater was $16 trillion at an annual rate, then the amount of income and expenditure during quater three was $4 trillion.",True,False,,,A,"*True, If the U.S. government reports that GDP in the third quarter was $16 trillion at an annual rate, then the amount of income and expenditure during quarter three was $4 trillion.
GDP is a combination of all private, public consumption, investment, cost, and foreign balance of trade. The report shows that GDP was %16 trillion at an annual rate, so for each quarter, the income and expenditure shall be $4 trillion. Hence, the statement is TRUE.","The U.S. GDP: The United States of America's (USA) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the largest GDP in the world. Further, GDP determines the growth of a nation's economic development."
26,Real GDP is nominal GDP adjusted for changes in,the price level.,the inflation rate.,population.,the unemployment rate.,A,"Real GDP is nominal GDP adjusted for changes in
A. the price level.
Real GDP is calculated as the difference between nominal GDP and the inflation rate. The inflation rate is the rate of changes in the price level. That is, real GDP is adjusted for inflation and due to this, it gives an accurate measurement for growth.
Analysis of incorrect options
B. the inflation rate is incorrect because real GDP is adjusted for inflation rate rather than changes in the inflation rate.

27,"Because of _____ resource prices, Green GDP has been _____.",rising; overestimated,falling; overestimate,rising; underestimated,falling; underestimated,C,"The correct option is (c.)
The country's progress is accumulated by the condition of the people, environmental sustainability, and increased economic growth.
The Green GDP enhances the services provided by natural resources. It helps in examining the biodiversity and environmental losses within the country. The rising of the resources price will underestimate the Green GDP because the green GDP focuses on environmental sustainability and concerns the interrelation of the market with nature.
Underestimating the green GDP will cause adverse effects on the sustainability and allocation of resources. The inappropriate use of resources will cause harm to the environment as well as to humankind. The resources acquired by the industrialist will be affected as there will be no resources left for productivity, and the country will lower its GDP.
Thus, underestimating the Green GDP will cause severe outcomes for the environment and simultaneously rises the prices of the resources that will affect the country's growth.
Reason for incorrect answers:
Option (a.)
The rising prices of the resources and overestimating the green GDP will only create losses to the environment and other sectors because GDP and Green GDP work simultaneously for the country's growth.
Option (b.)
If the fall in resource price will affect GDP, the estimate of green GDP does not provide satisfaction because the overestimation of green GDP only depends on preserving the social and environmental costs.
Option (d)
The green GDP states the social benefits for society. The resource price fall will underestimate the green GDP and will not occur because of this environmental loss.",Green GDP: The green gross domestic product is the measure of the economic growth with environmental factors that will encourage the country's simultaneous rate of actual GDP. The green GDP concerns environmental sustainability and the country's growth rate.

If real GDP increases, it is known for sure that output has risen.
The real GDP is the measurement of the value of final items and services in an economy at the base year prices. The base year is chosen on the basis that the year should be normal, i.e., no natural calamities or other political disturbances occur. Moreover, it should not be an ancient year but close to the present. The real GDP is said to present a clear picture of the economy, as it is measured in the base year, so an increase in its value signifies an increase in the economy's productivity. The formula for real GDP is:

{/eq}
Real GDP is the ratio of nominal GDP (N GDP) to GDP deflator. The deflator is the deviation of the current price from the base year price, and nominal GDP is the value of final items and services at current prices. Hence, real GDP depicts the actual growth in an economy.

33,True or false? Economists are concerned about inflation because real GDP is necessarily falling when there is inflation.,True,False,,,A,"Real GDP takes into account the value of inflation. Without inflation, the value of GDP is heavily inflated and does not seem to give a true picture of the growth. Real GDP is calculated as the ratio of nominal GDP to the price level.

a). Increase the reserve requirement or conduct an open market sale
When the central bank increases the reserve requirement, then the commercial banks hold more money in the reserve account, and because of this, the supply of money into the economy gets low. Due to a lower money supply, companies' access to the fund becomes limited, which deters production. So the GDP melts down. The Federal Reserve also sells securities in the open market to grab the money supply from the economy. The ultimate purpose of the Fed is to reduce the money supply in the market to reduce GDP.
Option b is not correct because open market purchases will shift money from the fed to the open market, and this will boost GDP.
Option c is not correct because decreasing the reserve requirement will increase the amount of money available to commercial enterprises, and due to the availability of funds, production will be motivated.

option B.
There is a close connection between the price level and GDP. Price, on average, reflects the country's financial strength. When prices fall persistently, the economy experiences faster real GDP growth than the nominal GDP. This situation implies that output volume has increased in the economy. When supply surpasses demand, businesses are compelled to cut the prices of their products. After the price cut, things become less expensive; thus, people's buying capacity increases.
The above situation denotes negative inflation, in which people enjoy an average price level decline. GDP deflator helps understand this situation since it shows variation in prices of all domestic products. However, when the GDP deflator value is low, real GDP growth surpasses nominal GDP growth. Now, people experience either low inflation or deflation.
Reasons for incorrect options are:
