{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{Weight of ABC}}\, &= \,\frac{{{\rm\text{Amount of ABC}}}}{{{\rm\text{Amount of ABC}}\, + \,{\rm\text{Amount of XYZ}}}} \times 100\\

&= \frac{{\$ 90,000}}{{\$ 90,000 + \$ 60,000}} \times 100\\

&= 60\% \\

{\rm\text{Weight of XYZ}}\, &= \,\frac{{{\rm\text{Amount of XYZ}}}}{{{\rm\text{Amount of ABC}}\, + \,{\rm\text{Amount of XYZ}}}} \times 100\\

&= \frac{{\$ 60,000}}{{\$ 90,000 + \$ 60,000}} \times 100\\

&= 40\%

\end{align*}

{/eq}","Portfolio's Expected Return: Portfolio's expected return is the altogether expected return of the portfolio depending upon the weights of the financial securities in the portfolio. The higher the risk, the greater is the value of the expected return."
2,A measure of the average value of a random variable is called a(n):,variance,standard deviation,expected value,coefficient of variation,C,"The expected value of a frequency distribution is the weighted average of all the observations taken. It is calculated by taking the weighted sum of all observations, weighted by their frequency, and dividing it by the total number of observations., This gives us the average or representative value of the frequency ditribution.
Hence,
option c. expected value
is the correct answer.","Measures of Central Tendency: The measures of central tendency help us to find the middle or average or representative values of a frequency distribution. The common measures of central tendency are the mean (sum of values divided by the number), the mode (the most frequent value), and the median (the middlemost value when the observations are increased in ascending order). The standard deviation is another measure that helps to represent how spread out the data is from the average value."
3,"A company had annual returns of 16 percent, 9 percent, -4 percent, and 13 percent over the past 4 years. What is the standard deviation of the returns for this period?",7.63 percent,8.81 percent,13.46 percent,15.26 percent,B,"The correct answer is option B. 8.81 percent
Step 1: Calculation of average return:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm{Average}}\,\,{\rm{Return}} &= \frac{{{\rm{Sum}}\,\,{\rm{of}}\,\,{\rm{observations}}}}{{{\rm{Number}}\,\,{\rm{of}}\,\,{\rm{observations}}}}\\ &= \frac{{16\% + 9\% + \left( {4\% } \right) + 13\% }}{4}\\ &= \frac{{34\% }}{4}\\ &= 8.5\% \end{align*} {/eq}
Therefore, the average return is 8.5%
Step 2: Calculation of variance:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm{Variance}} &= \frac{{{{\left( {{\rm{Value}}\,\,{\rm{of}}\,{\rm{each}}\,{\rm{observation}} - {\rm{Average}}\,{\rm{return}}} \right)}^2}}}{{{\rm{Number}}\,{\rm{of}}\,{\rm{observations}} - 1}}\\ &= \frac{{{{\left( {16\% - 8.5\% } \right)}^2} + {{\left( {9\% - 8.5\% } \right)}^2} + {{\left( { - 4\% - 8.5\% } \right)}^2} + {{\left( {13\% - 8.5\% } \right)}^2}}}{{4 - 1}}\\ &= \frac{{56.25\% + 0.25\% + 156.25\% + 20.25\% }}{3}\\ &= 77.66\% \end{align*} {/eq}
The variance is 77.66% or 0.7766
Step 3: Calculation of standard deviation:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm{Standard}}\,{\rm{Deviation}} &= \sqrt {{\rm{Variance}}} \\ &= \sqrt {77.66\% } \\ &= 8.81\% \end{align*} {/eq}
Therefore, the standard deviation is 8.81%",Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is used to investigate the extent of dispersion of the data in the observations from the mean. It navigates the data back to the predefined mean position to estimate the dispersion.
4,A measure of the riskiness of an asset held in isolation is:,Beta,Standard deviation,Covariance,Semi-variance,B,"The answer is
b. Standard deviation
For an asset held in isolation, standard deviation is an appropriate measure of risk since it will account the volatility of the asset price around the mean of prices during a specific period. This measure would be representative for the risk associated with asset.","Riskiness: Riskiness of a security refers to the uncertainty in price fluctuation, which will affect the investment efficiency. However, note that a risky security will promise a higher expected return to investor."
5,The financing period:,"is the time it takes to purchase inventory, sell it, and collect the sales.",defines how much additional financing the company must have to support its operations.,is calculated as days' sales uncollected minus days' inventory on hand minus days' payable.,measures a company's short-term debt-paying ability.,B,"The answer is
option B.
The financing period is from when the company's obligations to its supplier are due until the end of its operating cycle. So, it is time that the firm determines how much money is needed to finance its business operations.
Analysis of other options
A. The statement defines the company's operating cycle, which is the time from purchasing inventory until the collection of credit sales.
C. The statement describes an incorrect formula for the cash conversion cycle. The correct one is days' sales uncollected
plus
days' inventory on hand minus days' payable.
D. It defines the current ratio.","Capital Structure: The company's capital structure includes equity and debt. These are the firm's sources of funds for running the business and daily operations, like purchasing materials."
6,"A consultant predicts that there is a 25% chance of earning $500,000 and a 75% chance of earning $100,000. The expected profit is $200,000. The standard deviation is:","$120,000","$160,000","$166,000","$173,200",D,"We are given:
The expected profit (X) is $200,000.
The probability of earning $500,000 (P1) is 25%.
The probability of earning $100,000 (P2) is 75%.
The higher earnings (H) are $500,000.
The lower earnings (L) are $100,000.
Calculation of the standard deviation (SD):
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{SD}} &= \sqrt {{\rm\text{P1}} \times \left( {{\rm\text{H}} - {\rm\text{X}}} \right)_{}^2 + {\rm\text{P2}} \times \left( {{\rm\text{L}} - {\rm\text{X}}} \right)_{}^2} \\

7,"A portfolio has an actual return of 15.17%, a beta of 0.85, and a standard deviation of 7.2%. The market return is 13.4% and the risk-free rate is 2.8%.",2.25%,2.51%,2.67%,3.36%,D,"The portfolio's Jensen's alpha is 3.36% (D)
The calculation is shown below.
Alpha = Expected return on portfolio - (Risk-free rate + (Beta * (Market return - Risk-free rate)))
Alpha = 15.17% - (2.8% + (0.85 * (13.4% - 2.8%)))
Alpha = 15.17% - (2.8% + (0.85 * 10.6%))
Alpha = 15.17% - (2.8% + 9.01%)
Alpha = 15.17% - 11.81%
Alpha = 3.36%","Standard Deviation: Standard Deviation is a measure that shows how much variation from the mean exists. Like the variance, if the data points are close to the mean, there is a small variation whereas if the data points are highly spread out from the mean, then it has a high variance."
8,Positive cash flow from financing activities on the statement of cash flows means that a company has:,collected more from customers than it paid for operating expenses.,borrowed more than it is paying off.,paid a large cash dividend to shareholders.,"sold more property, plant, and equipment than it purchased.",B,"The correct option is B. borrowed more than it is paying off.
The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
A. collected more from customers than it paid for operating expenses.
No the collection of cash from customers and payment of operating expenses are operating cash flows.
B. borrowed more than it is paying off
This is the correct alternative. New borrowings are cash inflows from financing activities on the statement of cash flows and debt repayments are cash outflows, so when a company borrows more money than it is paying back, its financing cash flow will be positive.
C. paid a large cash dividend to shareholders.
No, dividends paid are a cash outflow in the financing activities section so it would lead to a negative cash flow from financing activities on the statement of cash flows.
D. sold more property, plant, and equipment than it purchased.
No, this would lead to a positive cash flow from investing activities,",Interpreting the Statement of Cash Flow: The cash flow patterns in the statement of cash flow give users an indication of the business cycle a company is in and how it needed to manage its cash asset during the reporting period. Certain cash flow patterns are typical of start-up companies and others of established companies.
9,What of the following is not one of the characteristics of long-term debt financing?,cost.,control.,risk.,inventory.,D,"The correct option is
D. inventory
.
Explanation:
Inventory is a feature of long-term debt finance that is unrelated to it. Raw materials, work-in-process commodities, and finished products are examples of a corporation's manufacturing, sale, or distribution inventory. Long-term debt financing may give a firm the funding it requires to make big expenditures in its business while spreading payments out over a longer period.
Explanations for incorrect options:
Option A- Cost: Long-term debt financing is often more expensive than short-term debt financing owing to the long payback time and the interest rate charged.
Option B- Control: In the case of long-term debt financing, lenders may have more influence over the borrower since they have a larger commitment to the borrower and may need certain covenants or limits on the borrower's actions.
Option C- Risk: Long-term debt financing is riskier than short-term debt financing since it has a longer repayment duration, increasing the possibility of default.","Long-Term Financing: Long-term debt financing entails borrowing cash for a period exceeding a year to finance a company's major operations. Financial institutions provide it, although it may also be received from other sources."
10,The purpose of the Z transformation is to correct for:,varying shape of the sampling distribution of r.,an unknown mean of the sampling distribution of r.,an unknown standard deviation of the sampling distribution of r.,differing values of n.,A,"The
z
-score in the Z transformation or Fisher Z-transformation is the standard normal variable, distributed normally with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
We use Z transformation to make the distribution of Pearson's correlation coefficient '(r)', normal. We then use these
z
-scores to construct confidence intervals for the correlation coefficient
(r)
or while conducting the hypothesis tests for the difference between the correlation coefficients from two independent samples.
The formula that we use to transform the r into a Z-score is as follows:
{eq}z' = \dfrac{1}{2} \ln \left( \dfrac{1+r}{1-r} \right) {/eq}
There is a table as well, we call it the ""r to z table"". It represents the
z
-scores for different values of
r.
Hence, we can say that the purpose of the Z transformation is to correct for
a. the varying shape of the sampling distribution of
r
.
Explanation for the incorrect options
:
For an unknown mean of the sampling distribution of r
:_ z- transformation's purpose is to make the distribution of
r
normal. It is not for computing or correcting the unknown mean of the sampling distribution of
r
.
An unknown standard deviation of the sampling distribution of r
:_ Similar to the unknown mean, we do not use z-transformation for an unknown standard deviation.
Differing values of n:
n
represents the sample size. We do not use z-transformation to correct for the different values of
n.","Correlation Coefficient: The correlation coefficient, or Pearson's correlation coefficient, is denoted by {eq}r {/eq}. It is used to calculate the association between two different variables. It indicates how strong (or weak) and in what direction the association is. For example, there is a strong negative association between {eq}x {/eq} and {eq}y {/eq}, which means an increase in the {eq}x {/eq} is strongly associated with a decrease in the {eq}y {/eq}."
11,The idea that investors in common stock may expect a lower total return if they purchase a stock with limited price volatility rather than one with high price volatility suggests that:,investors are irrational.,there is a relationship between risk and return.,real rates of return will be lower during periods of price stability.,stocks should be avoided when inflation is low.,B,"The correct answer is
B.
A direct correlation exists between uncertainty and the earnings expected by the investors on their investment. The higher the risk factor, the higher potential returns are expected and vice-versa. If the price volatility of a stock is less, it is established that there is less risk that will give fewer returns. However, if the volatility is high, there are high risk and returns.
Option A is not correct since investors rationally make decisions.
Option C is not correct since real rates of return will be lower during periods of price fall.
Option D is incorrect since investment in stocks can be made when inflation is low.",Price Volatility Price Volatility shows the adverse movements in product prices being traded in the markets. It is caused by variations in the demand and supply of products and services. The percentage variation in the daily price level measures its price volatility.
12,"If the standard deviation of the continuously compounded returns {eq}(\sigma)

{/eq} on a stock is 40%, and the time interval is a year, then the upside change equals:",88.2%,8.7%,63.2%,49.2%,D,"The correct answer is
D) 49.2%
Given information:-
The standard deviation of a continuously compounded return on a stock = 40%
Time interval: 1 year
The formula will be:-
(1 + u) = e ^ (40%)
(1 + u) = e ^ (0.4)
= 1.4918
Converting the amount in percentage:-
= 1.4918*100
= 49.18 or 49.2%
The upside change will equal to 49.2%.","Returns: Returns refer to the amount of funds generated back to the person after he invests his hard-earned income considering all the risks associated with a security. The people tend to invest in the share market, stock market, bond market, and even in government securities and others."
13,Commercial bank term loans,usually carry fixed interest rates.,are very short-term in nature.,are offered to superior credit applicants.,both b and c.,A,"A. Correct.
A term loan can usually be offered with a fixed interest rate for the entire loan duration.
B. Incorrect. A term loan can be a long-term borrowing. For instance, a mortgage loan has a maturity of 30 years.
C. Incorrect. A term loan can be offered to any individual or organization that meets the lender's requirements.","Term Loan: A term loan refers to borrowing that requires regular repayments at fixed intervals for a particular period. Usually, each periodic payment includes both the interest and the principal repayment."
14,"When we form an equally weighted portfolio of stocks and keep increasing the number of stocks in the portfolio, the volatility of the portfolio also increases.",True,False,,,B,"The above statement is
false
Volatility acknowledges as the measure which is widely used in computing the option prices in the stock market. Volatility is the rate at which the price increases or decreases in the stock market. It determines the scope by which the value of assets or security may rise or decline; therefore, the above statement is incorrect.","Portfolio Portfolio is defined as the combination of a variety of assets or security in a portfolio with the aim of minimizing the overall risk and increasing profitability. It includes the financial assets which comprises of the shares, bonds, and cash equivalent."
15,Cash flow can be said to equal operating income _____.,less taxes plus depreciation,less taxes,before depreciation and taxes plus depreciation,after taxes minus depreciation,A,"The correct answer is option
a. less taxes plus depreciation
.
The cash flow from operating activities can be calculated by making the following adjustments to the net operating income:
Deduct taxes
Deduct change in the working capital
Add back the non-cash expenses like depreciation expenses and amortization expenses","Cash Flow Statement: The cash flow statement for a firm shows the net cash flows during a given period from three kinds of activities, namely, operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The cash flow from operating activities can be computed by using the direct method or indirect method."
16,When making decisions. Investors are interested in assessing:,the company's ability to generate net cash inflows.,management's ability to protect and enhance the capital providers' investments.,Both a and b.,the company's ability to generate net income.,C,"Correct Answer:
Option c. Both a and b
.
Investors should assess any company on the following basis:
The company's ability to generate cash flows, not a net income, as cash flows provide a more realistic efficiency of the business.
The company's ability to enhance the capital invested by investors and protect it from risks of bankruptcy.
Net income includes noncash expenses that can mislead the actual numbers that a company generates.",Users of Financial Statements: Every company should file its financial statements annually for the users to be aware of a company's financial performance and position for any given year. These metrics help them make investment decisions.
17,"Calculate the standard deviation of the following set of scores: 1.3, 1.6, 0.8, 1.1, 0.7.",0.37,0.45,2.01,1.30,A,"The first step of computing the standard deviation is to find the mean of the sample data. Using the following formula, we construct the mean as shown below:
{eq}\bar {x}=\dfrac {1}{n} \sum {x_i}\\

=\dfrac {1}{5} (1.3+1.6+...+0.7)\\

=1.1

{/eq}
Substituting the mean in the following formula, we compute the standard deviation as shown below:
{eq}s=\sqrt {\dfrac {1}{n-1}\sum {(x_i-\bar {x})^2}}\\

=\sqrt {\dfrac {1}{5-1} (1.3-1.1)^2+(1.6-1.1)^2+...+(0.7-1.1)^2)}\\

=0.3674

{/eq}
The answer is a) 0.37.",Standard Deviation Standard deviation is one of the measures of variability for continuous data. This measures the deviation of individual scores from the average of the data. Thus mean and standard deviation are used as the preferred measures of central tendency and variation for variables measured on an interval scale.
18,A company that is leveraged is one that _____.,has a strong investment portfolio,has a high earnings per share,contains debt financing,contains equity financing,C,"The correct option is
c. contains debt financing.
A leveraged company is one that has taken on debt in order to fund its operations or growth. The term ""leverage"" is used to describe the practice of taking on debt in the belief that future profits will be enough to cover the loan's interest payments.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
Option a. has a strong investment portfolio:
There is no correlation between a company's investment portfolio and its level of debt, so this answer choice is incorrect.
Option b. has a high earnings per share:
A high EPS simply indicates that the company is making a lot of money in relation to the number of shares it has issued, so this choice is incorrect.
Option d. contains equity financing:
Equity financing is the wrong choice because it implies borrowing money rather than raising capital through the sale of shares.","Equity Financing: Equity financing is the method to get funds for business operations, growth, research and development, expansion, and other purposes. The company sells its share, known as ownership, to the public at large to get funding."
19,"The average monthly cell phone bill (the parameter) for a particular carrier in Pittsburgh, PA is $90. Which of the following is most likely?",The average monthly bill (a statistic) for 50 randomly selected customers (of this carrier) is over $115.,The average monthly bill (a statistic) for 250 randomly selected customers (of this carrier) is over $115.,Both A and B are equally likely.,,A,"Now, in this example, the average phone bill for a particular carrier in Pittsburgh, PA is $90.
Now, as the sample size increases the standard deviation will decrease and hence the likeliness of the value being over $115 decreases as we move towards a bigger sample.
The average monthly bill (a statistic) for 50 randomly selected customers (of this carrier) is over $115 is more likely than the average monthly bill (a statistic) for 250 randomly selected customers (of this carrier) is over $115.
Thus the correct answer is -
a. The average monthly bill (a statistic) for 50 randomly selected customers (of this carrier) is over $115.","Standard Deviation The effect of the sample size on our are mean and standard deviation are very interesting and should be fully understood before deciding on the ideal sample size for our experiment. As the sample size of our sample increases, the standard deviation of the mean decreases and vice versa which basically means that if we decrease the sample size the standard deviation increases."

25,State true or false and justify your answer: Individual common stocks' betas have a tendency to move toward 1.0 over time.,True,False,,,A,"The answer is true.  Recent studies, including a 1992 article by Fama and French, shows that for an individual stock, past and current betas are not a good predictor of future beta. They suggest that a beta tends to mean revert, meaning a stock with a beta greater than or less than 1.0, will move toward 1.0 over time.",Stock Beta: Beta is a measure of a stock's risk relative to the broader market.  It is an indication of the extent to which a stock's price moves in relation to the market.  A beta of 1.0 moves in sync with the market.  A beta of less than 1.0 is less volatile than the broader market (defensive stock).  A beta of greater than 1.0 is more volatile than the broader market (tech stock).

Standard deviation is used to calculate the total risk that a security accompanies. It helps in better decision-making by forecasting the risks involved in an investment portfolio or a security. It includes the measure of both systematics and unsystematic risk and so gives a view of the total risk of the security.
The analysis of incorrect options is as follows:
A. The systematic risk of the security is measured using the beta coefficient. It is generally used to measure the risk of a well-diversified portfolio by considering its sensitivity to the factors relating to systematic risk.
B. The unsystematic risk of the security is measured by subtracting systematic risk from total risk. The systematic risk is computed by using beta coefficient and the total risk is computed using standard deviation.
D. The risk per unit of return for the security is measured using the coefficient of variation. It is computed by dividing the standard deviation by the expected rate of return. It acts as a standardized measure to identify the risk that every asset carries.
So, these options are incorrect.","Security: Security refers to a financial instrument that can be traded in the market in exchange for funds. It is used for raising capital for businesses. Security can also be kept as collateral at the time of purchase of a loan. Since the value of a security is related to the market, it carries certain risks. The risk can be systematic and unsystematic."

40,Which of the following measures the impact of a change in the underlying stock price volatility on an option price?,Vega,Rho,Delta,Theta,A,"The correct answer is option
a. Vega.
The deviation in the price of an option due to an up or down in the volatility of the underlying asset is assessed by vega. An increase in volatility will generally lead to an increase in option prices, and a decrease in volatility will generally lead to a decrease in option prices. The option price will change due to a shift of even one-point implied volatility.
Explanation for the incorrect options:
b. Rho
: Rho is a risk measure that indicates how much the price of an option will change in response to a change in the interest rate. It gauges how sensitive an option price is to interest rate fluctuations. It shows how much the option price will change if the risk-free interest rate changes by one percentage point.
c. Delta
: The alteration in the price of an option due to an increase or decrease in the price of the underlying asset is assessed by delta. It is represented as the amount that the option price will change for a one-point change in the underlying asset price. It reflects positive value for the call options.
d. Theta
: Theta is a way through which the fall in the price of the option can be seen in consideration of time. It shows how the option price will alter for each passing day to expiration. Theta is often used to evaluate the effect of time decay on option prices, which tends to erode the value of options as they approach expiration.",Stock Market Volatility: Stock market volatility is a metric people use to determine the total increase or decrease in the stock market value.
