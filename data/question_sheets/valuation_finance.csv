4,"Kessen Inc.'s bonds mature in 7 years, have a par value of {eq}\$1,000 {/eq}, and make an annual coupon payment of {eq}\$70 {/eq}. The market interest rate for the bonds is {eq}8.5\% {/eq}. What is the bond's price?",{eq}\$923.22 {/eq}.,{eq}\$946.30 {/eq}.,{eq}\$969.96 {/eq}.,{eq}\$994.21 {/eq}.,A,"Given information:
Par value = $1,000
Coupon value = $70
Maturity period (n) = 7 years
Interest rate (r) = 8.5 % or 0.085
The components needed to calculate the bond price are the coupon value, the bond's par value, the maturity period, and the interest rate. So, using all these components, the formulation of the bond price is as follows:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm{Bond \;price}} &= {\rm{Coupon\; value}} \times \left[ {\frac{{1 - \frac{1}{{{{\left( {1 + {\rm{r}}} \right)}^{\rm{n}}}}}}}{{\rm{r}}}} \right] + \frac{{{\rm{Par \;value}}}}{{{{\left( {1 + {\rm{r}}} \right)}^{\rm{n}}}}}\\ &= \$ 70 \times \left[ {\frac{{1 - \frac{1}{{{{\left( {1 + 0.085\% } \right)}^7}}}}}{{0.085}}} \right] + \frac{{\$ 1,000}}{{{{\left( {1 + 0.085} \right)}^7}}}\\ &= \$ 70 \times 5.1185 + \$ 564.9263\\ &= \$ 358.295 + \$ 564.9263\end{align*} {/eq}

5,All of the following statements regarding impairments are true except:,an impairment is a permanent decline in an asset's market value.,"after an impairment write-down, depreciation is generally lower in subsequent periods.",immediate recognition of impairment write-downs is now required.,impairments are generally recorded when the book value falls below the market value.,D,"The correct option is d.
Impairments are generally recorded when the book value falls below the market value
.
The above statement regarding impairments is not true. Impairments are generally recorded when the
market value falls below the book value
of the asset. An impairment loss is recorded when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value.
For example, for a building with a cost of $1,000,000 and accumulated depreciation of $150,000, the book value will be $850,000. If the market value of the building is $2,000,000, there will be no impairment loss. But if the market value falls to $500,000, the impairment loss will be $350,000 and must be recorded by the company during the period the market value fell.
The other answer options regarding impairments are true:
a. -
An impairment is a permanent decline in an asset's market value
is correct because impairments are not recorded when the decrease in an asset's market value is deemed temporary.
b. -
After an impairment write-down, depreciation is generally lower in subsequent periods
is also correct because, after the impairment write-down, the asset's carrying amount will be lower. The new carrying amount is used to calculate the annual depreciation expense.
c. -
Immediate recognition of impairment write-downs is now required
is also correct because the accounting standards require that impairment losses be recorded in the period they are incurred.",Impairment Loss: An impairment loss is recorded as an operating expense in the income statement when the impairment of long-term assets has been identified. Companies are required to test the long-term assets for impairment periodically.
6,The contract that describes the terms of a borrowing arrangement between a firm that sells a bond issue and the investors who purchase the bonds is called the _____.,trustee,indenture,debenture,,A,"A. Incorrect. A trustee refers to an individual or an organization that administers assets or investments on behalf of others.
B. Correct. The indenture contract will detail all related information about the bond: coupon rate, maturity, attached provision, etc.
C. Incorrect. Debentures are long-term debt securities, which are bonds.","Bonds: Bonds are recommended securities to investors who prefer s stable stream of cash inflows to reduce the overall credit risk. Besides periodic coupons, a bond issuer will receive the bond's par value at its maturity. However, bonds can be sold in the exchange market for immediate cash."

The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
a. Debit Truck $8,000; Credit Cash $3,000 and Credit Accounts Payable $5,000
This is the correct alternative because the truck asset must increase with the total amount and assets increase on the debit side. The cash asset decreases with the cash payment and the Accounts Payable liability increases with the balance.
b. Debit Truck $8,000; Credit Cash $8,000
Not all of the purchase price was paid in cash.
c. Debit Truck $5,000 and Credit Accounts Payable $3,000
Some of the purchase price was paid in cash.
d. Debit Truck $8,000; Credit Cash $3,000 and Credit Accounts Receivable $5,000
Accounts Receivable is used to record sales on account, not purchases on account.","Purchase of an Asset: Property, plant, and equipment purchases are recorded in asset accounts.

9,The value of a bond is the present value of the:,maturity value.,interest payments and maturity value.,dividends and maturity value.,interest and dividend payments.,B,"The correct option is b. interest payments and maturity value.
The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
a. maturity value.
The present value of the periodic interest payment also affects the value of bonds.
b. interest payments and maturity value.
This is the correct alternative because the present value of the periodic interest payments plus the present value of the maturity value (both calculated using the market interest rate as the discount rate) is equal to the proceeds received on the bond issue i.e. its value.
c. dividends and maturity value.
Bonds pay interest, not dividends
d. interest and dividend payments.
There are no dividend payments on bonds.",Value of a Bond: The value of a bond on its issue date is usually not the same as its face value because market interest rates are almost always different from the coupon rate of the bond. The difference between the issue price and the face value is called the premium or discount on the bonds.
10,"Indicate whether the following statement about operational assets and liabilities is true or false. When several long-term assets are purchased in a single transaction, the purchase price is allocated among the assets based on their relative fair values.",True,False,,,A,"It is
true
to say that when several long-term assets are purchased in a single transaction, the purchase price is allocated among the assets based on their relative fair values.
Plant assets are accounted for in asset groups such as equipment, building, and land improvements and the depreciation policy is often determined for a group of assets. Also, the cost and annual depreciation of individual assets are recorded in the fixed assets register and this register is then used to calculate the gain or loss when the asset is subsequently sold. This means that when several long-term assets are purchased in a single transaction, the total purchase price cannot be recorded as a lump sum in the accounting records, because then the depreciation expense and the eventual gain or loss would be inaccurate. Therefore, the transaction price is allocated among the assets based on their relative fair values.","Cost of a Plant Asset: The cost at which a plant asset is recorded affects the balance sheet over the asset's life. It is also the basis for the depreciation expense, so the cost also has an effect on the net income as calculated in the income statement over the asset's life."

Incorrect. Subordinated debentures are ranked after all other debts in a firm. Hence, subordinated bonds are more riskier than regular debentures.
b. Incorrect. Mortgage bonds are backed by real estate. In detail, the real estate will be liquidated to repay the bondholders when the bond issuer cannot maintain its payments to bondholders.
c. Correct. Since subordinated bonds are riskier. The interest rate on these bonds should be higher than regular bonds.
d. Incorrect. Debentures are unsecured debts. The interest rate is declared according to the issuer's creditworthiness.","Corporate Bonds: A corporate entity is eligible to sell bonds to the public to raise more debt capital.

c) Profitability index, internal rate of return, and net present value
.
Capital budgeting techniques help a company make investment decisions based on how profitable the investment is. Some of these techniques don't use the time value of money.
Payback period and accounting rate of return are the two best examples of capital budgeting techniques that don't use the time value of money in their computations. The payback period uses the annual cash flows provided by the investment, whereas the accounting rate of return uses the average annual net income.
Other techniques, such as net present value, discounted payback, profitability index, internal rate of return, and modified internal rate of return, use the time value of money.
The time value of money is crucial to determine an investment's profitability because it requires converting the year-end cash flows to today's value to understand if the spending is more or the present worth of the future cash flows is more. Present value computations are significant in the long run. The option chosen represents techniques that use time value and are more reliable compared to the ones not applying the time value concepts.
Based on the options given, all the listed tools provided in Option C) are based on the time value of money.",Time Value of Money: The time value of money is a concept that provides that money's worth today is different from its worth on a future date due to its potential to earn. We use the present and future value computations for various investments based on this concept.

a. True
. It is
true
to say that held-to-maturity securities should be reported on the balance sheet at cost along with any unamortized discount or premium.
Held-to-maturity is the only investment classification that is carried on the balance sheet at the amortized cost of the investment. This means that if an investment in the bonds of Company S with a face value of $100,000, was purchased for $105,000, this investment would initially be carried on the balance sheet for $105,000 (the cost). The premium of $5,000 is then amortized over the bond's term, but the carrying amount will always include the unamortized premium.",Held-to-Maturity Securities: Held-to-maturity securities are investments in debt securities like bonds. This classification cannot be used for investments in equity securities because equity securities like common and preferred stock do not have a maturity date.

b. Bond price and maturity:
The answer is
A. As the time to maturity increases, the price of the bond decreases.
Previous bond prices with different maturities indicate that as the time to maturity increases, the value of the bond decreases. An increase in maturity will raise the discount factor, which results in a decrease in the bond's present value.",Bond Valuation: The value of a bond refers to its fair price estimated by discounting expected coupon payments and the maturity value to today.

A. We should use the general dividend discount model to value the stock of a firm with rapid or changing growth.
The statement is false because the dividend growth rate under the general dividend discount model is assumed to be constant. Thus, it is used to value stocks with a stable business and constant growth. Since a rapidly growing firm does not satisfy the constant growth rate assumption, it cannot be valued using the general dividend discount model.
The other options are not the answer because they are true.
B.
As firms mature, their growth slows to rates more typical of established companies:
As a business grows, it faces increased competition, which limits its growth potential. As a result, the growth rate starts slowing down and ultimately mirrors the growth rate of mature and established companies.
C.
The dividend discount model values the stock based on a forecast of the future dividends paid to shareholders:
The dividend discount model is a discounted cash flow model. Thus, the intrinsic value of a stock is the sum of all the dividend payments an investor expects to receive as a result of investing in it.
D.

{eq}\text{Sustainable growth rate} = \displaystyle \text{ROE} \times (1 - \text{Dividend payout ratio}) \\ \text{Sustainable growth rate} = \displaystyle \text{ROE} \times (1 - \displaystyle \frac{\text{D1}}{\text{EPS}}) \\ \text{Sustainable growth rate} = \displaystyle 15\% \times (1 - \displaystyle \frac{\$1}{\$10}) \\ \text{Sustainable growth rate} = 13.5\% {/eq}
The correct answer is
b. 13.5%.","Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR): A company's sustainable growth rate is the maximum growth rate to achieve without acquiring external capital. Alternatively, this growth rate is encouraged by the company's retained earnings."

46,"Determine whether the following statement regarding bonds issued at a premium is TRUE or FALSE. On the date of issuance, the net book value of the bonds payable will be higher than face value.",True,False,,,A,"The statement is
true
. It is
true
to say that on the date of issuance, the net book value of the bonds payable that are issued at a premium will be higher than face value because:
The net book value of bonds on the issue date is equal to the cash received from the bond issue.
Bonds are issued at a premium when the market interest rate is lower than the bonds' stated interest rate.
This means that investors are willing to pay more for the bonds than their face value because they can pay more and still generate the market rate of return from the future cash interest payments. This means that the cash received will exceed the cash value of the bonds.
This also makes sense if we remember that the premium on bonds payable and the bonds payable liability are recorded with credit entries, and the two account balances are added up to calculate the net book value of the bonds.",Bond's Issuance Price: Bonds' issue price is the price the market is willing to pay for the bonds on the date they are sold for the first time. The issuer receives this amount in cash on the issue date. The market determines this price based on prevailing interest rates and the issuer's risk profile.
47,A bond will sell at a premium when _____.,its coupon rate is greater than its current yield and its current yield is greater than its yield to maturity,its coupon rate is greater than its current yield and its current yield is less than its yield to maturity,its coupon rate is less than its current yield and its current yield is greater than its yield to maturity,its coupon rate is less than its current yield and its current yield is less than its yield to maturity,A,"The correct answer is option
A. Its coupon rate is greater than its current yield and its current yield is greater than its yield to maturity.
A bond will sell at a premium if the coupon rate is greater than its yield to maturity. The coupon rate represents the coupon amount expressed as a percentage of face value whereas the current yield represents the coupon amount expressed as a percentage of selling price. When a bond sells at a premium, it implies that the selling price is more than the face value so we can say that the coupon rate is greater than the current yield.","Bond Valuation: A bond may be issued at a premium to the face value, at a discount to the face value, or at the face value. The issue price is predominantly affected by the prevailing market interest rate or yield to maturity and the stated coupon rate."

The stock's required rate of return is 12%. What is the expected dollar dividend at the end of three years?",$2.38,$3.12,$5.00,,A,"Dividend growth rate aids in measuring the average growth of a company's dividend payments made to the investors on an annual basis. It is required to compute the share price of a company when applying the dividend discount model for stock valuation.
Given information:
Dividend paid= $2
Growth rate= 6%
Step 1: Determine the dividend paid in year 1, as shown below:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Dividend at year 1}\left( \text{D1} \right)\text{ } &=\text{ D0 }\times \text{ }\left( 1+\text{Growth rate} \right) \\ &=2\text{ }\times \text{ }\left( 1+6\% \right) \\ &=\$2.12 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Step 2: Determine the dividend paid in year 2, as shown below:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Dividend at year 2}\left( \text{D2} \right)\text{ } &=\text{ D1 }\times \text{ }\left( 1+\text{Growth rate} \right) \\ &=\$2.12\text{ }\times \text{ }\left( 1+6\% \right) \\ &=\$2.247 \end{aligned} {/eq}

The dividend paid in year 3 is $2.38. Thus, the correct answer is
option a. $2.38.",Constant Growth Model: The constant growth model is a method of assessing shares. It is also called the Gordon Growth Model. This model assumes that a company's dividend payments always increase at a fixed rate.
49,"A stock just paid a dividend of $1.50. The required rate of return is 8.5%, and the constant growth rate is 4%.",$36.11,$35.15,$35.63,$34.67,D,"The correct answer is
d. $34.67
.
The components that make up the dividend growth model equation are given below:
Expected dividend (Note 1) = $0.75
Required return = 8.5%
Constant growth rate = 4%
Upon the arrangement of these components logically, we have the following outcome:
{eq}\text{Stock's current price} = \dfrac{\text{Expected dividend}}{\text{Required return - Constant growth rate}} = \dfrac{\$1.56}{8.5\% - 4\%} = \$34.67 {/eq}
Note 1:
Expected dividend = Current dividend × (1 + Constant growth rate)
Expected dividend = $1.50 × (1 + 0.04)
Expected dividend = $1.56","Expected Dividend: The expected dividend is the amount of dividend receivable in the next period. When the growth rate is constant, we can determine the expected dividend using the last paid dividend. The expected dividend is discounted to determine the stock price."

option a. $22.50.
Given information:
Next year's earnings = $3
Retention rate = 30%
Returns on earnings (ROE) = 20%
Cost of equity = 10%
Step 1: Determine the growth rate by multiplying the retention rate with ROE:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Growth rate } &=\text{ Retention ratio }\times \text{ Return on equity} \\ &=\text{ }30\%\text{ }\times \text{ }20\%~ \\ &=\text{ }6\% \end{aligned} {/eq}
Step 2: Determine the expected dividend:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Expected dividend } &=\text{ Expected earnings }\times \text{ }\left( 100\text{ }-\text{ Retention ratio} \right) \\ &=\$3\text{ }\times \text{ }\left( 100-30\% \right) \\ &=\text{ }$3\text{ }\times \text{ }70\% \\ &=\text{ }\$2.10 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Step 3: Determine the stock price by dividing the expected dividend by the value obtained after subtracting the growth rate from the cost of equity:
