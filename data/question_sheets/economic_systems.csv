1,OPEC is the:,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.,Organization of the Pre-European Commission.,Oil Producing Economies Caucus.,Organization of the Problematic Economies Committee.,A,"The correct answer is option
a. Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The OPEC is a body consisting of various countries that are the major exporters of crude oil and petroleum products across the globe. It is a cartel consisting of 13 member countries. They usually regulate the supply and prices of crude oil across the world. Moreover, each member of the cartel supplies the crude oil at an agreed-upon price.","Competitions in a Free Market: The economic systems can be categorized into the free market economy, command economy, and mixed economy. Furthermore, the types of competition that could exist in a free market can be classified into monopoly, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, or perfect competition."
2,Which of the following is not an example of the government's role in helping create wealth?,Assessing property taxes.,Providing federal courts to adjudicate contract disputes.,Providing protection against criminals.,Recording property transactions.,A,"Which of the following is not an example of the government's role in helping create wealth?
A. Assessing property taxes.
Assessing property taxes may be necessary, but it does not assist in creating wealth. In a market economy, wealth is created by individuals who believe their rights to own and use property are protected. All of these are part of the government's role in protecting the property of individuals so that they will be confident in taking risks and using resources to improve their incomes and create wealth:
B. Providing federal courts to adjudicate contract disputes.
C. Providing protection against criminals.
D. Recording property transactions.",Market Economy: A market economy is characterized by individuals who own resources and who can use them as they see fit to earn income to provide for their needs.
3,"The most important factor that qualifies a market as a ""free market"" is:",limited barriers to entry or exit.,little or no government interference.,protection of private property rights.,no actor in the market has the ability to affect or exert any control over the market.,B,"The most important factor that qualities a market as a ""free market"" is
b. little or no government interference.
The United States is often put forward as an example of a free market, and it is a fairly free market. Singapore is an example of a smaller country with even fewer regulations than the United States. According to Adam Smith, the free market is necessary for capitalism.
These answers are incomplete or incorrect:
a. limited barriers to entry or exit.
This would be a characteristic of little or no government regulation.
c. protection of private property rights.
This would be a part of the small amount of government regulation.
d. no actor in the market has the ability to affect or exert any control over the market.
No, because monopolies may exist in the absence of regulation.","Market Economy: Adam Smith, the Father of Economics, conceived of a system where markets operated according to the laws of supply and demand, where people owned and controlled resources, and where they traded based on their self-interest."
4,The synchronized application of capital to a wide range of different industries is called _____ by its advocates.,balanced growth,capitalization,elasticity of capital,indivisibilities,A,"The correct option is
a) Balanced Growth
A balanced economy grows by allocating resources evenly across many sectors. Some people think this is the best way out of poverty. The term ""balanced growth"" is used to describe a certain kind of economic expansion that can be maintained over time. It is long-lasting due to low inflation, minimal impact on the natural environment, and a healthy distribution of economic activity between exports and consumer spending.","Capitalization: Capitalism is a kind of market in which the means of production are owned privately and run by private firms for profit. It has core features like accumulation of capital, open competition, private property, etc."
5,True or False: Swapping one good for another also called bartering.,TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The correct answer is
True.
People exchange goods for other goods or services and participate in barter trade. A barter system is a trading activity where goods and services are exchanged for other goods and services. For example, when a farmer needs fertilizer but only has grains of maize, he will have to search for another individual that needs maize but has fertilizer to complete the barter system. The farmer and the individual who need maize grains will agree on the quantity that suits both items and carry out the exchange through a barter system. Because there is no medium of exchange such as money, goods and services are exchanged for other goods and services hence a barter system.","Benefits of Trade: Trade is an important economic activity that has several benefits to an economy. Through trade, global poverty can be eradicated. When there is free trade among countries, economies tend to grow faster because they innovate, improve economic productivity, and receive higher incomes through increased job opportunities for individuals. Activities such as open trade help lower-income households by providing goods and services at affordable prices."
6,"Milton Friedman, throughout his career, was known as a strong proponent of aggressive countercyclical monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.",TRUE,FALSE,,,B,"The statement, ""Milton Friedman, throughout his career, was known as a strong proponent of aggressive countercyclical monetary policy by the Federal Reserve,"" is
b. False.
Milton Friedman was a conservative non-activist who was the leader of a group called the Monetarists in the second half of the 20th Century. His position was that the Federal Reserve should match the growth of the money supply to the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and do nothing else.","Countercyclical Monetary Policy: Countercyclical monetary policy means an activist monetary policy of adjusting interest rates, reserve requirements, and open market operations to ""fine tune"" or influence the level of economic activity frequently and consistently over time."
7,"If you buy equal amounts of a 1 beta stock and a 2 beta stock, your portfolio will have a 1.5 beta.",TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The statement is
TRUE.
Weight of stock 1 = Weight of stock 2 = 50%
Beta of stock 1 = 1
Beta of stock 2 = 2
Since the two stocks are invested equally, the portfolio beta is the average beta of the two stocks.
{eq}\beta_{portfolio} = \displaystyle \frac{\beta_{stock_1} + \beta_{stock_1}}{2} \\ \beta_{portfolio} = \displaystyle \frac{1 + 2}{2} \\ \beta_{portfolio} = 1.5 {/eq}","Beta Coefficient: The systematic risk or the market risk cannot be reduced by diversification. However, an investor can minimize the systematic risk according to the measure of the volatility of the security's return, known as the beta coefficient. An investor can balance the overall risk by including negative and positive beta securities in the portfolio."
8,Which of the following are factors that affect international trade flows?,government restrictions,exchange rates,inflation,All of the above.,D,"The answer is d. All of the above.
a. government restrictions is correct. Restrictions from a government will limit imported goods and services from other countries. In this case, other countries will enter other new markets where there is fewer restrictions.
b. exchange rates is correct. The currency exchange rate will affect the price of domestic goods and foreign goods. A country will intend to import cheaper products, which affects its current account.
c. inflation is correct. Inflation affects the value of a currency. Thus, it will affect a country's imports and exports.","International Trade: International trade refers to the exchange of goods, services, and capital between countries. These exchange transactions occur because each country will not have all the needed resources for economic growth."
9,A beta coefficient of 0 represents an asset that _____.,is less responsive than the market portfolio,is unrelated to the market portfolio,is more responsive than the market portfolio,has the same response as the market portfolio,B,"The answer is
B. is unrelated to the market portfolio
A beta coefficient of 0 indicates that the stock return and the market return are not correlated. Alternatively, a change in the return of the market portfolio will not affect the stock return.",Beta Coefficient: The beta coefficient describes how volatile the stock return is against the market return. A negative beta indicates that the stock return and the market return move in opposite directions.
10,Standard deviation measures _____ risk while beta measures _____ risk.,systematic; unsystematic,unsystematic; systematic,total; unsystematic,total; systematic,D,"The correct answer is option
D. total; systematic
.
The total risk of an investment is measured by the standard deviation. On the other hand, the systematic risk or market-wide risk is measured by the beta value. The total risk can be bifurcated into systematic risk and unsystematic risk.",Risk: A portfolio's performance is usually measured by two important metrics called risk and return. The objecitve behind having a portfolio is to maximize the returns without taking incremental risk.
11,"Government rules and regulations, properly devised, can",improve the function of property rights.,limit free-riders.,reduce negative externalities.,all of these choices.,D,"Government rules and regulations, properly devised, can
D. all of these choices.
Yes, the government's role in a market economy is to do all these. The rights to own and maintain property are essential to the profit motive of a market economy. Free riders are those who get a benefit without paying for it, and some cases should be limited. Government can reduce negative externalities such as pollution by a system of fining polluters or by taxing them more to clean up the negative externality.","Role of Government in a Market System: In a market system, as initially described by Adam Smith in 1776, the government was only charged with maintaining a legal system, a monetary system, and providing national defense. Expectations of what the government should do have expanded significantly since then."
12,Factor proportions theory is also known as the:,comparative advantage theory.,laissez-faire theorem.,Heckscher-Ohlin theorem.,product cycle model.,C,"The correct option is c.
Factor proportions theory is also known as the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem.
The Heckscher-Ohlin theorem is one of the theories of international trade, also known as the Factor proportions factor intensity theory. The theory asserts that international trade occurs due to the differences in the factor endowments in the countries. The theory explains why there arises a difference in costs in production in the countries. According to this theorem, the countries rich in labor export labor-intensive products, and countries rich in capital export capital-intensive products. As the theory gave importance to the endowment of factors that countries have and their differences, this theory got named the factor proportions theory.
Reasons for incorrect options
Option a.
Comparative advantage theory is one of the classical theories of international trade, emphasizing that trade exists due to comparative cost differences among countries.
Option b.
The Laissez-faire theorem is one of the assumptions on which classical economists base their theories.
Option d.
The product cycle model is the representation of the life cycle of a product.","International Trade: International trade is the exchange of products globally. Global trade is a complex phenomenon as it transfers economic fluctuations from one nation to another. Certain tools are used to restrict the inflow of foreign products and disturbances, like tariffs, quotas, import duties, voluntary export restraints, and others."
13,The use of government to supplant market outcomes is called:,market failure.,free riding.,rent-seeking.,efficiency.,A,"The use of government to supplant market outcomes is called
market failure (choice A.)
A market failure is a term that describes an economic situation in which goods and services are not efficiently distributed in the economy under the free market system.  Governments intervene in market failures to address the inefficiencies or failures.
Free riding (choice B.) would not be the correct option because the term refers to people gaining economic benefit from a system that they are not paying or supporting.
Rent-seeking (choice C.) would not be the correct option because it refers to people and organizations trying to benefit from the economic system without producing any benefits for others.
Efficiency (choice D.) would not be a correct option because while the goal is efficiency, government action is due to a market failure and may or may not be efficient.","Free Market: A free market is an economic model in a capitalist economic system in which goods and services are freely and voluntarily exchanged throughout the economy, according to the laws of supply and demand. A free market functions without the intervention or regulation imposed by a governing body."
14,"If an individual perfectly competitive firm raises its price above the market price, it will:","sell some output, but less than previously.",not sell any output.,sell more output than previously.,sell the same amount of output as previously.,B,"The correct option is b) do not sell any output.
In a perfectly competitive firm, the prices are determined by the demand and supply of the product, and customers are fully aware of the market. If the prices are high, buyers will not purchase the product at all because there are other sellers selling the same product or services at lower prices.
Other options
Option a is not correct because due to high prices buyers will not purchase the products.
Option a is not correct because output will not be sold.
Option a is not correct because the change in price will affect the demand.","Market Price: The market price is the price for any assets, property, or goods that can be bought and sold. The market price is largely determined by demand and supply and other market factors of the market."
15,Which of the following will result in an increase in a consumer's purchasing power?,An increase in the consumer's income.,A decrease in the price of the good on the vertical axis.,A decrease in the price of the good on the horizontal axis.,All of the above.,D,"Explanation: All of the above-mentioned statements will result in increasing the consumer's purchasing power. Increase in income of consumer will increase the money in hand, and he will have more money to spend. When prices of goods and decreased, a consumer can buy more items with the same amount of money, thus, resulting in an increase in its purchasing power. Lastly, a decrease in the price of goods on the horizontal axis means a decrease in the prices of substitutes. When prices of substitutes are decreased, a consumer will shift to them and can buy more with the same sum of money. Hence, all these situations result in increased purchasing power of the customers.","The Budget Line In business, a budget line shows is a downward sloping line how a consumer can spend her entire income in the consumption of different bundles of goods or services."
16,"In a competitive, free enterprise economy, consumer demand is the principal determinant of what and how much is produced.",TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The correct option is
a).True
In a free market, the demand and supply of the products determine the price, and the demand also determines how much to supply. Under- and overproduction, both scenarios will result in losses for the company. The companies forecast the demand ahead of time and manufacture the products accordingly. There is no command by the government or any third party to manufacture.","Free Economy: Here the word ""free"" represents the external forces and commands that pressurize the manufacturers. In a free market, there is no pressure on the manufacturer to manufacture a certain limit, but they get the demand from the market and manufacture accordingly."
17,"If consumers were willing to sacrifice the differentiation of a product with many producers, then the price of the product could be lower.",TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The statement, ""If consumers were willing to sacrifice the differentiation of a product with many producers, then the price of the product could be lower, is
a. True
A market structure with many producers of products that are differentiated fits the definition of monopolistic competition. Some people believe that the proliferation of products and the advertising dollars spent to persuade consumers to buy them are a waste of resources. Many people have asked whether we need so many shampoo and ready-to-eat breakfast cereal.
However, the alternative doesn't fit a market-based economy. The other option in the extreme is what command economic systems do. A government official determines the type and ingredients of a product called ""toothpaste,"" and that's what everybody has the chance to buy - no differentiation of features that add benefits and no consumer choice. It would be true that the price would likely be lower, but the element of consumer sovereignty would be lost. For some, that is a less desirable option. It's also true that many jobs are created by product branding and differentiation, in fields such as packaging and advertising.","Market Structures: All firms in a market-based or mixed economic system generally fit into one of these categories: pure/perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition."
18,All _____ economies have been political dictatorships.,centrally planned,mixed,market,mixed and market,A,"The correct option is
a) centrally planned
In a centrally planned economy, all the decisions related to the economy, such as production and pricing, are taken centrally, and buyers and sellers do not have control over the production and prices. Generally, there are state-owned enterprises that manufacture the products. So centrally planned economies have political dictatorships.
The explanation for other options
Option b is not correct because a mixed economy is a combination of capitalism and socialism, and the market forces take decisions.
Option c and d are not correct because, in a market economy, market participants take decisions.","Capitalism: Capitalism is an economic structure where the capital goods are owned by the business people and individuals, and the owners of the business give employment to the people in exchange for their work and perform business activities."
19,Which of these countries has the least economic freedom?,Australia,Cuba,France,Singapore,B,"The correct answer is
B) Cuba.
Of the listed countries, Cuba has the least amount of economic freedom. In 1959 the Cuban Revolution was complete and the Communist party led by Fidel Castro took power. Communist governments have very high levels of control over the economy with many businesses being state-owned. Individuals are allowed some freedoms to own property and operate businesses, but this is very limited compared to economic freedoms in other nations. Australia, Singapore, and France all operate as mixed economies with many capitalistic economic freedoms that are not allowed in Cuba.","Private vs. State-Owned Business: Privately owned businesses are operated by individuals for the purpose of generating profits that will be retained by the owners. Private organizations are commonly found in highly capitalistic societies and nations. State-owned businesses are owned by the government and profits are not distributed to individual stateholders. Many communist and socialist countries will have a greater degree of state-ownership of businesses, especially larger organizations. However, even in capitalistic nations, some businesses are state-owned. This typically occurs in areas of national security or in industries where monopolies may be a necessity."
20,"The short-run Phillips curve shows that if other things remain the same, _____.",an increase in expected inflation will lower the unemployment rate,a fall in unemployment will lower the inflation rate,the inflation rate rises by 1 percent when unemployment falls by 1 percent,a rise in the inflation rate and a fall in the unemployment rate occur together,A,"The correct Option is a.) A budget line
.
The budget line is the line drawn between the two points representing the number of each good the consumer consumes. It shows the combination of two goods that a consumer purchases at a given price and the consumer's income. A change in the price of one of the goods preferred by the consumer would change the consumption point of that good. It causes the slope of the budget line to change. The indifference curve (IC) touches the budget line at a point where it is tangent.
Reasons for incorrect options:
Option b.)
The demand curve does not show the consumers' preferences in a commodity bundle.
Option c.)
The line shows the association between the two preferred goods does not deal with price discrimination.
Option d.)
The indifferent curve (IC) only demonstrates the combination of goods at each point that provides the same utility. However, it does not depict the change in the price of the goods.","Indifference Map: In economics, the indifference map depicts the curve that graphically represents all the combinations of various quantities of goods and services that gives consumers the same satisfaction level from consumption of the bundle."
21,A price decrease and an increase in income are similar in that:,Both force the consumer to achieve a lower level of well-being.,Both force the consumer to reach a lower indifference curve.,Both move the budget line outward.,They are not similar at all.,C,"The correct option is
c. Both move the budget line outward
.
The budget line depicts the line that graphically expresses the different consumption points consumers can easily attain with the available income source. The budget line shifts with the changes in the consumers' purchasing power. A fall in all the products' prices increases the purchasing power of the consumers as they can purchase more of the products at a lower price. Similarly, a rise in consumers' income increases their purchasing power as they can spend more on purchasing products. Hence, both changes will result in a right and an outward shift in the budget line.
The other options are incorrect.
a. Both force the consumer to achieve a lower level of well-being. Lower products price and increases in income increase the purchasing capacity of the consumers, which forces consumers to achieve a higher level of well-being.
b. Both force the consumer to reach a lower indifference curve. The consumer will likely achieve a higher indifference curve tangent to the new budget line above the initial one.
d. They are not similar at all. The changes are similar as both of them increase the consumers' purchasing capacity, enabling them to attain more products in their consumption bundle.",Products' Price: The products' price refers to the value (monetary) consumers have to pay to purchase goods and services from the sellers in the market. The willingness of sellers and consumers to sell and acquire depends on the products' price.
22,A barter system is _____.,similar to a money system of payment because both are used as stores of value and units of account,different to a money system because money doesn't require a double coincidence of wants,,,B,"A barter system is
b. different from a money system because money doesn't require a double coincidence of wants.
Double coincidence of wants means that a trade can only happen if you find a party who has what you need and needs what you have. In a complex modern economy, that is very difficult. Money serves as a medium of exchange that facilities fast and efficient exchanges.
A barter system is cumbersome compared to a money system of payment. Money is easier to use because it is a store of value and a unit of account. That means money holds its value and can be used to compare the value of two goods or services.","Barter Economy: Barter means trading goods or services without a money system. Every kid has likely traded baseball cards, marbles, or Barbie doll clothes. On a larger scale, earlier societies traded without having a money system."
23,"A stock's total risk consists of company-specific risk, which can be eliminated by diversification, plus market risk, which cannot be eliminated by diversification.",TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The statement 'A stock's total risk consists of company-specific risk, which can be eliminated by diversification, plus market risk, which cannot be eliminated by diversification' is
true
as market or systemic risk impacts a wide range of asset types and cannot be reduced through portfolio diversification. Specific or unsystematic risk impacts only one industry or firm; an investor manages risk through diversification. Diversification can minimize or eliminate unsystematic risk. Still, it can't do the same for systematic risk.",Market Risk: Market risk is faced by an investor when the market value of a financial instrument falls. It tends to influence the whole market simultaneously and is not limited to a single economic commodity.

'The market risk of a portfolio is equal to the weighted average market risk of its components, and the total risk of a portfolio is equal to the weighted average total risk of its components.' is
False
.
A portfolio's beta, which indicates its sensitivity to the entire market, is frequently used to gauge its market risk. Because component correlations might impact the portfolio's overall risk, a portfolio's beta is not always the same as the weighted average of the betas of its components. The weighted average of the entire risks of a portfolio's components is also not equivalent to the overall risk of the portfolio, which includes both market risk and unique risk.",Market Risk: Market risk is the risk connected to variations in an investment's value brought on by changes in the general financial market. Diversification cannot eliminate market risk and has some impact on all assets.
25,A closed economy is a national economy that:,doesn't interact economically with the rest of the world.,has a stock market that is not open to traders from outside the country.,has extensive trading and financial relationships with other national economies.,has not established diplomatic relations with other national economies.,A,"The correct options are
A) doesn't interact economically with the rest of the world.
The concept of economic trade does not exist in closed economies. A closed economy neither exports goods or services to nor imports goods or services from other nations. These economies don't buy or sell shares, debentures, bonds, or other financial instruments to other countries. They also don't lend to or borrow from them, accept presents from or give gifts to foreigners, or engage in any of these activities themselves. Therefore, it is clear from the concept of a closed economy that it doesn't interact economically with other nations.
The other options are incorrect.
B) has a stock market that is not open to traders outside the country. A closed economy only considers not trading in goods and services and is not related to the stock market.
C) has extensive trading and financial relationships with other national economies. Closed economies do not have any economic or financial relationships with other economies.
D) has not established diplomatic relations with other national economies. Closed economies do not have economic or financial relations with other nations but can have political or diplomatic relationships.","Trading Nation: Trading nations typically prefer free trade and economic integration, or they desire market access for their goods and some form of protectionism for their industries. The most in-demand products have the largest markets."
26,The market system is also called the price system because,rising prices are the signal to producers to offer more of a particular good.,everything has a price tag.,inflation is a significant problem.,people pay money in markets.,A,"The correct option is a. rising prices are the signal to producers to offer more of a particular good.
When supply and demand interact to set prices, we have an economic system known as the market system or the pricing system. An increase in the price of a commodity tells suppliers that more of it is needed to meet consumer demand. As demand for a product or service declines, its price drops, sending a message to its suppliers that they can create less of it.
Here are the reasons why the other options are not true:
The following are the arguments against the alternative explanations:
b. Although a market system's prices indeed reflect the value of goods and services, that's not why it's named the price system.
c. Inflation is a major issue in a market system, but it isn't the reason why the system is named the pricing system.
d. While exchanges in markets are facilitated by monetary transactions, this is not why the system is referred to as the pricing system.","Free Market: A free market is a type of economy where the government has a lesser role in deciding the prices of products and services, as well as their demand and supply. But market forces have total dominance in determining the demanded supply and also the prices of the products and services."
27,Which of the following is not a diversifiable risk?,"The risk that oil prices rise, increasing production costs",The risk of a product liability lawsuit,The risk of a key employee being hired away by a competitor,The risk that the CEO is killed in a plane crash,D,"The correct answer is
Option D
.
Diversifiable or unsystematic risk is inherent to a specific company or industry and can be reduced or eliminated through diversification. This type of risk is related to company-specific events such as management changes, product recalls, or legal issues.
Let's analyze the options below:
Answer Options
Analysis
A) The risk is that oil prices will rise, increasing production costs.
It is a diversifiable risk because production costs can be adjusted.
B) The risk of a product liability lawsuit
Risks emerging from legal issues can be mitigated.
C) The risk of a critical employee being hired away by a competitor
This risk can be diversified by increasing the efficiency of the hiring team with increased standards.
D) The risk that the CEO is killed in a plane crash.
This risk is totally natural and cannot be mitigated as the output is based on factors that cannot be controlled, even if well taken care of.","Types of Risk: Systematic risk is the overall risk inherent in an entire market or economy. Unsystematic risk, on the other hand, is specific to a particular company or industry. Because of how they are defined, each risk has different diversification rules."
28,What is the main characteristic of a capitalist or free market economy?,Individuals are the owners of factors of production,Profit is the main motive for carrying out various activities,Consumer freedom,All of the above,B,"The correct answer is
B. Profit is the primary motive for carrying out various activities
The profit motive is the main feature associated with capitalist or free market economies. In this market, the private sector controls the factors of production, such as property, while the laws of supply and demand govern the prices of goods and services. Capitalists mainly aim to make a profit despite letting prices of goods and services be determined by the laws of supply and demand.
Consumer freedom is also a feature of the capitalist economy because consumer tastes and preferences control demand and supply. Another part of capitalist markets is that there are few government interferences, and businesses or individuals can start any business of choice.
The correct answer is, therefore, choice B because market profits drive capitalists. Choices A and C are also features of capitalist markets, but the main one is the profit motive. Hence choices A, C, and  D are incorrect.","Economic Systems: Economic systems play a vital role in ensuring that economic resources are redistributed, and the flow of goods and services is monitored or controlled effectively. The government serves the role of outlining the legal and social regulatory frameworks dictating how an economy should operate. It also facilitates and maintains favorable competition for goods and services. The government also does provide public goods and services. The government is also in charge of redistributing income, correcting externalities, and stabilizing the economy within the economic systems."
29,Which of the following is a function performed by market prices?,Market prices communicate information to buyers and sellers.,Market prices coordinate the decisions of buyers and sellers.,,All of the above are functions performed by market prices.,D,"The correct answer is
D) All of the above are functions performed by market prices
.
Market prices communicate a lot of information about a product or service. Rising prices signal to buyers that the good is in high demand or has limited supply and can hence be in the future. On the other hand, falling prices suggest a surplus or decreased demand. The information provided by market prices helps buyers to decide what and when to buy and sellers to decide the quantity to supply to be economically beneficial. So, option A) is a function performed by market prices.
The market price of a good is the price at which that good is sold and purchased in the market. A buyer looks for alternatives or decides to wait if the market price seems to be higher than expected. Similarly, a seller holds back the stock for the future if the market price seems to be lower than expected. The transaction happens only when the buyer and seller agree on the market price. So, market prices coordinate the decisions of buyers and sellers, and thus, option B) is also a function of market price.
Entrepreneurs seek profits from their investments. If the market price of a good is sufficiently higher than the cost of production, there is a potential profit in the production and sale of that good. This profit potential acts as a motivation for entrepreneurs to conduct business with such goods where the profit potential is high and divert investments from such goods where the market price is lower than the costs of production. So, market prices provide valuable information to entrepreneurs and motivate them to produce desired products. Hence, option C) is also a function performed by market prices.
Since all three options are functions performed by market prices, the answer option D) is correct.","Price: The price of a good or service is the value that needs to be paid in exchange for that good or service. Generally, price is reflected in terms of monetary value and is determined through the interaction of demand and supply in a market."
30,Capitalism is an economic system:,based on government intervention in the means of production.,that originated in the United States in the 19th century.,where private owners of capital make decisions based on profit.,that dominated developing economies in the 19th century.,C,"Capitalism refers to one of the forms of economy in which buyers and sellers are free from government intervention, and people are allowed to have private ownership of capital and factor of production for profit motive.
Therefore, the correct option is:
c. where private owners of capital make decisions based on profit.","Types of Economy: Different nations opt for different types of economies based on their characteristics in terms of population density, means of production, availability of resources, and so on. Different types of the economy include mixed economy, capitalist economy, and so on."
31,The primary reason to explain why some nations are rich and others poor is:,A strong judicial system.,Private ownership.,A democratic government.,Access to education.,B,"While all of these answers contribute to the success of nations, the answer to this question is
B. Private ownership
. Being able to own the means of production in an economy allows producers and households to improve and build wealth over time. When property can not be owned, there is less incentive to improve it for the future and it can not be used as an asset to build further wealth. In many wealthy nations, private ownership allows households and firms to borrow against it and build more wealth or productive capabilities. Private ownership can also attract foreign investment which creates more opportunities for an economy as well. If property rights are unclear, this can also slow economic growth and wealth generation as is typical in developing nations. When the government owns property, as in a command economy, there is a low incentive to improve property and capital and use it in its most productive way. Well-defined, established property rights are common in wealthy countries and one of the main drivers of future economic growth.",Economic Systems: An economic system is a set of formal and informal rules that govern the economy of a country or region. Economic systems are judged on a range of how the basic economic questions are answered. These questions are: 1. What should be produced? 2. How much should be produced? 3. How should it be produced? 4. Who in society gets the production? Economies with more economic freedom tend to be labeled as capitalistic and economies with more restriction tend to be labeled as command or restrictive economies.

b) does have an impact on the possibility of an efficient outcome and does have a distributional impact.
The assignment of property rights for an externality aims to produce a net benefit for the collective but may come with a negative expense for some individuals. Assigning property rights may impact the efficiency of production and the management of the property. The assignment will shift social and wealth dynamics in a way that may upset free trade and capitalism. The assignment of property rights will definitely have a distributional impact. Attempting to assign property rights for an externality will likely result in those with more giving up some of their property for reassignment to those in need. This is by definition a distribution and will have a distribution impact.",Free Market: A free market exists when there are no barriers or restrictions placed on private citizens and businesses to conduct trade. Prices within a free market as set by supply and demand without government interventions. Many governments have mixed economies with many principles supporting free market practices but all governments have some forms of economic regulations preventing the existence of a true free market economy in the world today.
33,"Since the 1950s, trust in government has _____.",increased drastically.,increased some.,sharply declined.,stayed about the same.,C,"The correct solution to this problem is provided by
option C: sharply declined
.
The solution suggested above assumes that the problem discusses the United States government. It is based on an analysis conducted by Pew Research. According to the analysis, the people's trust in the government in 2022 is significantly lower compared to in 1958. In 2022, approximately 20% of the participants stated that they trust their government. In 1958, 73% of the participants trusted the government.","Public Trust: The people's trust in their government indicates the degree to which they believe in the actions of the government. It is an important part of governing, since public trust would translate to public support. When the general public does not trust their government, they are less likely to support the policies and programs it proposes."
34,"War, inflation, and the condition of the foreign markets are all examples of _____.",internal risk,non-diversifiable risk,unsystematic risk,business-specific risk,B,"A. Incorrect. The internal risk is the risk incurred within the firm or an investment. Alternatively, the internal risk is specific to an investment.
B. Correct. These mentioned events occur and affect all industries, which is considered systematic risk or non-diversifiable risk.
C. Incorrect. See the explanation in part B.
D. Incorrect. These risks affect all business sectors or the entire economy, which is not specific to a single organization.","Risk: Risk refers to an uncertain event that affects the value of an asset or an investment. With that being said, investors intend to forecast potential risks in the future, which can help them to minimize losses on their capital."
35,Sources of unsystematic risk include:,1 and 2,1 and 3,2 and 3,All of these choices.,A,"The answer is
A. 1 and 2 .
1. Correct. A firm's financing decisions cause potential risk to the existing operations only, which will not affect other firms in the market.
2. Correct. A firm will engage in its operational risks, which should be particular for the firm, rather than other firms in the same business sector.
3. Incorrect. The fluctuation in the market price of a stock refers to the systematic risk, in which the price is impacted by the movement of the entire market.",Unsystematic Risk: The unsystematic risk of a business refers to specific risks associated with the business mainly. These risks can be diversified if the firm establishes a portfolio of different types of assets.
36,Which is not the characteristic of a socialist or planned economy?,Government is the owner of resources,The government determines production decisions,Profit motive,,C,"The correct answer is
C. Profit motive
In socialist and planned economies, the public's welfare comes first over other private needs, such as property ownership. In this type of economic system, the economic activities are organized through planning instead of market forces and drive production towards achieving societal needs rather than profit. Because socialist and planned economies are a type of command economy, they are controlled and regulated by the government to ensure equal opportunity for all in society.
The socialist or planned economy bears the following characteristics; public ownership of resources, classes of society, equal opportunity for all, price mechanism, and planned economies.
Choices a and b are characteristics of socialist economies because production and ownership of resources are the sole roles of the government for social welfare; hence they are incorrect.
Choice c is not a feature of socialist economies but rather a feature of the capitalist economies operating on profit motives; hence is correct.","Importance of Economic Systems: Economic systems control the various factors of production, such as capital, land, labor, and other physical resources. Economic systems help provide national defense through government regulation of resources and consumer protection. Additionally, economic systems help solve environmental issues by adopting social and economic welfare. They also help in the protection of property rights as well as increasing competition in the economic markets."

d. It has become more difficult to organize an efficient and successful firm
Competition, the complexity of regulations, globalization, and shifting market dynamics are just some of the reasons why it's harder than ever to organize a successful firm in a market economy. These difficulties may make it more difficult to launch and sustain a profitable business in today's competitive market.
Here are the reasons why other options are not true:
a. It has become easier as more and more firms discover how to do it: This is false because it presumes that it has become easier to organize a successful firm in a market economy as more firms have discovered how to do it. However, evidence is lacking, and this may not be true, as setting up a business can be difficult even with more information and experience.
b. As government intervention has decreased, firms now have more freedom: It is false to assume that reduced government intervention has resulted in greater freedom for firms to organize and operate in a market economy. While fewer regulations from the state might make some aspects of starting a business easier, this doesn't mean that it's simpler to launch a profitable enterprise overall.
c. There has been no change one way or the other over the last century: No significant economic, technological, or social changes have occurred in the last century, so it's unlikely that there has been no change in how to organize a successful firm in a market economy over the last century. Since many factors affect how a company is structured, it's unlikely that nothing has changed in the last century.","Free Marke Economy: In a free market economy, the resources are owned not by the government but by private players, and the prices of the products and services are also determined by the private players. The company decides how much to produce and to whom to sell."
38,Property rights:,need to be universal.,do not promote incentives.,do not promote efficiency.,only need to be found in wealthy segments of the population.,A,"Property rights:
A. need to be universal.
The individuals in a market economy need to know that they are guaranteed the right to own and use their property to earn income and wealth. Property rights promote entrepreneurship and motivate behavior.
These answers are incorrect:
B. do not promote incentives. } Just the opposite - property rights do promote incentives.
C. do not promote efficiency.
Property rights do promote efficiency.
D. only need to be found in wealthy segments of the population.
No, property rights must be for everyone, regardless of how much property they own.",Market Economy: A market-based economy is one where individuals control resources and decide how to use them. A democratic political system usually goes along with a market-based economic system.
39,Unsystematic risk:,is increased through diversification,is reduced when markets fluctuate less,is affected by the nature of how a firm finances its operations,increases during periods of volatile interest rates,C,"The correct answer is option
C. is affected by the nature of how firm finances its operations
.
Unsystematic risk is a firm-specific risk that is not affected by external factors like volatility in the market and interest rates. It can be reduced by diversifying the investment made in a portfolio. It is primarily dictated by the factors related to a firm like the supply of materials, financing of operations, and demand for products.",Risk: The total risk associated with a stock can be bifurcated into systematic risk and unsystematic risk. The objective of creating a portfolio of stocks from various industries is to reduce the risk without affecting the expected returns.
40,Beta coefficients of 1.3 indicate:,the stock has more unsystematic risk,the stock has less unsystematic risk,the stock is more volatile than the market,the stock is less volatile than the market,C,"The correct answer is option
C. the stock is more volatile than the market
.
The beta coefficient is a systematic risk coefficient that denotes the sensitivity of returns on a given stock to changes in the market returns. It is calculated by taking a product of the correlation between stock & market returns and the ratio of standard deviation of the stock returns & and the standard deviation of market returns. Thus, a beta value of more than 1 indicates that standard deviation or volatility of stock returns is more than the volatility of market returns.",Beta Coefficient: The beta coefficient for a stock represents the responsiveness of stock returns to market returns. The rate of return required by shareholders of a firm is directly related to the beta coefficient and market risk premium.
41,"If the prices of both goods increase by the same percent, the budget line will:",shift parallel to the left,shift parallel to the right,pivot about the x-axis,pivot about the y-axis,A,"The correct option is
a) shift parallel to the left
.
The budget line represents the combinations of preferred goods that consumers can likely attain with their available income. An increase in the price of goods changes the slope of the budget constraint, pivoting about the X or y-axis. However, if the prices of the goods increase by the same percentage, then the budget line will shift parallel to the left. The left shift occurs due to a fall in the purchasing power of the consumers with the rise in price while consumers' income remains constant.
The other options are incorrect.
b) shift parallel to the right. The budget line moves outward with an increase in the purchasing power of the consumers.
c) pivot about the x-axis. The budget line pivots about the x-axis in response to a change in the price of one of the goods measured along the y-axis.
d) pivot about the y-axis. The budget line pivots about the axis due to an alteration in the price of one of the goods in the bundle.",Price of Goods: The price of the goods depicts the monetary values of the goods available in a market that are sold and purchased by the sellers and buyers. The goods' market price affects the entities' supply and demand responses.

c. Financing; lump-sum taxation is very rarely used.
Local government expenses are financed primarily through property taxes, paid by homeowners or landlords. These taxes are either part of a typical mortgage payment or must be budgeted by homeowners or businesses who own their property outright. This may be a lump-sum taxation when paid; however, it is pro-rated when people move from one jurisdiction to another. In the same way that consumers vote with their dollars, Tiebout asserts that they can ""vote with their feet.""
These answers are incorrect:
a. Mobility; many people are not perfectly mobile.
No, the assumption of mobility is not a limitation because it is correct.
b. Competition; people may not have perfect information about the benefits and taxes where they live.
No, people have the necessary level of data for the assumption to be valid.
d. All of the answers are the limitations of the Tiebout model.
No, because answer c. is correct.","Consumer Sovereignty: Consumers and households determine what goods and services are produced in a market economy. They do so by ""voting with their dollars"" and buying the goods and services they prefer."
43,The systematic risk of a stock is measured by its,beta coefficient,correlation coefficient,return standard deviation,return variance,A,"The answer is A) beta coefficient.
A) Correct. Within the CAPM model, the systematic risk is accounted by including the beta coefficient. This metric indicates how the required rate of return on a stock reacts to a change in market return.
B) Incorrect. A correlation coefficient is a metric to describe the relationship between two securities.
C) Incorrect. Return standard deviation is a risk measure for security.
D) Incorrect. Return variance is also a risk measure for security.","Systematic Risk: Systematic risk represents the risk associated with the entire market, which is not avoidable. In practice, diversification cannot eliminate systematic risk. However, investors can mitigate it by hedging or asset allocation strategies."

b. It provides owners with a strong incentive to develop and use assets in ways that others value highly.
Without assurance that your property is safe from theft or government seizure, the incentive to use what you own to make a profit for yourself is significantly reduced.
These answers are incorrect:
a. It eliminates the opportunity cost of using a resource.
No, there is always an opportunity cost in a world of scarce resources.
c. It allows owners to do anything they want with their property.
No, there are still rules about using your property.
d. It makes it possible for owners to ignore the desires of others without having to bear the cost.
No, property owners should use their resources to provide products and services that others want to buy. That's the way to earn a profit.","Role of Government in a Market Economy: Although there are differing views on how much a government should intervene in the economy, there is broad agreement that government must provide a legal system including the protection of property rights, a system of weights and measures and money, and national defense."
45,"It is possible for a firm to have a positive beta, even if the correlation between its returns and those of another firm is negative.",TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The statement is TRUE.
A positive beta indicates that the stock and the entire market will fluctuate in the same direction. Hence, this stock will be negatively correlated to firms whose beta coefficient is negative.","Beta Coefficient: The beta coefficient is a metric to depict the relationship between a stock's return and the market return. Alternatively, the beta coefficient is a factor representing the systematic risk."
46,Which of the following would be considered a systematic risk?,Business Risk,Financial Risk,Company Specific Risk,Market Risk,D,"The correct option is D.
Market risk is the chance that the value of an investment may fluctuate as a result of changes in the market or economy as a whole. Market risk is sometimes also referred to as systematic risk or non-diversifiable risk because it affects all companies or investments in a market, and cannot be diversified away.
On the other hand, business risk is the risk associated with a particular company's operations and includes factors such as competition, changes in consumer preferences, and technological changes. Financial risk, also known as financial leverage, refers to the risk of financial loss due to a company's debt financing, including interest payments and principal repayments.
In summary, market risk is considered a systematic risk because it affects all companies or investments in a particular market or asset class, while business risk, financial risk, and company-specific risk are types of unsystematic risks that can be reduced through diversification.",Systematic risk: Systematic risk is the risk that is inherent in the overall market or the entire economy and affects all securities and assets to some extent. It reduces exposure to certain market factors.
47,In the knowledge economy:,physical property rights appear to be lacking.,property rights have become stronger.,property rights have been replaced by network externalities.,intellectual property rights appear to be lacking.,D,"The correct option is (d.)
Inventions and innovations based on a public desire to provide property status have been classified as intellectual property rights (IPR). For the inventors or developers of that property to profit commercially from their creative endeavors or reputation, IPR grants them specific exclusive rights.
In a knowledge economy, gathering information secures innovative methods of working. The lack of intellectual property rights appears due to no copyrights and lack of patents for the property. Keeping the work or firm safe makes it more reliable for the firm to live long. The intellectual property owners must know the patents and copyright usage to keep them long-term.
Reason for incorrect answers:
Option (a.)
According to the knowledge economy, the lack of physical property rights will not be harmed as the firms or individuals fully secure the material properties. The owner wholly controls these tangible assets.
Option (b.)
In a knowledge economy, property rights become more vital for innovation. Still, the lack of patent and copyright measures can affect the life cycle of creative ideas.
Option (c.)
Property rights allow the outside party to demand compensation for a harmful externality. It alters the relative cost of the good, leading to a substitution impact in an economy that can rectify.","Knowledge Economy: The term ""knowledge economy"" refers to the tendency of advanced economies to rely more heavily on knowledge, information, and highly skilled workers. Collaborative networks can aid in enhancing knowledge distribution and gaining from innovative working methods."
48,The theory that assumes capitalist economies are dominated by large monopolistic firms is called:,Free market theory,Marxist theory,Green theory,,A,"The correct option is
option A)
.
The theory assumes large monopolistic firms dominate capitalist economies is called a free market theory.
The free market theory lets the market forces act among themselves without intervention from the authorities. There are no or fewer regulations and restrictions on these forces, and there is sovereignty in decisions regarding central problems. When the sellers have the authority to decide the number of goods and the market rate, they are said to enjoy the benefit of monopoly as there is a lack of regulation on output and market rate. Due to the freedom of firms, large firms can control the market.
Hence, the free market theory asserts that large monopolistic firms dominate capitalist economies.
Reasons for incorrect options are
Option B)
The Marxist theory asserts that capitalism ultimately leads to class struggle.
Option C)
The green theory asserts the importance of social justice, modernization, etc.","Market Systems: Many nations exist in the world economy, and each of these nations differs in some ways, although similar in some ways. The nations follow various market structures like socialist, capitalist, and mixed markets. All these segments are based on the freedom of market forces and intervention by the public authorities."
49,Which of the following is a function performed by market prices?,Market prices communicate information to buyers and sellers.,Market prices coordinate the decisions of buyers and sellers.,,All of the above are functions performed by market prices.,D,"The correct answer is
D) All of the above are functions performed by market prices
.
Market prices communicate a lot of information about a product or service. Rising prices signal to buyers that the good is in high demand or has limited supply and can hence be in the future. On the other hand, falling prices suggest a surplus or decreased demand. The information provided by market prices helps buyers to decide what and when to buy and sellers to decide the quantity to supply to be economically beneficial. So, option A) is a function performed by market prices.
The market price of a good is the price at which that good is sold and purchased in the market. A buyer looks for alternatives or decides to wait if the market price seems to be higher than expected. Similarly, a seller holds back the stock for the future if the market price seems to be lower than expected. The transaction happens only when the buyer and seller agree on the market price. So, market prices coordinate the decisions of buyers and sellers, and thus, option B) is also a function of market price.
Entrepreneurs seek profits from their investments. If the market price of a good is sufficiently higher than the cost of production, there is a potential profit in the production and sale of that good. This profit potential acts as a motivation for entrepreneurs to conduct business with such goods where the profit potential is high and divert investments from such goods where the market price is lower than the costs of production. So, market prices provide valuable information to entrepreneurs and motivate them to produce desired products. Hence, option C) is also a function performed by market prices.
Since all three options are functions performed by market prices, the answer option D) is correct.","Price: The price of a good or service is the value that needs to be paid in exchange for that good or service. Generally, price is reflected in terms of monetary value and is determined through the interaction of demand and supply in a market."
50,Select one. International trade:,Benefits rich countries but not poor countries.,Allows all countries to consume beyond their production possibilities.,Forces poor countries to consume exactly what they produced.,Requires poor countries to import more than they export.,B,"International trade is beneficial for both poor and rich countries. It allows poor or developing countries to make more imports than exports as it will lower the cost of a good for domestic consumers in poor countries. It allows all countries, rich and poor, to consume more than what they produce as they have an incentive to purchase goods and services from other countries that they are unable to produce efficiently.
Therefore, the correct option is:
B. Allows all countries to consume beyond their production possibilities.","International Trade: International trade refers to the trade that occurs between two or more countries when people of different nations make economic exchanges in terms of exports and imports of goods and services. International trade includes an exchange of technology, goods, capital, services, and other assets."
51,What primarily changes in a communist society?,People will no longer be able to earn their own products.,The power to subjugate the labor of others will be done away with.,People will no longer be able to marry the person of their choice.,Culture will be lost.,B,"The correct solution to this problem is provided by
choice B: The power to subjugate the labor of others will be done away with
.
The solution above is based on the idea put forward by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in their book,
The Communist Manifesto
. Below is an excerpt from chapter 2 of the book.
""Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labour of others by means of such appropriations.""
From the above excerpt, it is clear that choice A is incorrect. It is also clear that under communism, one would not have the power to subjugate the labor of others (choice B is correct).
Communism does not enforce forced marriage nor does it erode or destroy cultures.",Communism: Communism is a sociopolitical and economic theory often associated with the works of Karl Marx. Two examples of the primary characteristics of a truly communist society are statelessness and classlessness.
