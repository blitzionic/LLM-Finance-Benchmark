D. This question cannot be solved for a future value
.
Perpetuity refers to a series of cash flows for an infinite period. So, we cannot determine the future value (of $5,000 end-of-the-year cash flow) because it is a perpetuity, and the period is indefinite. However, we can evaluate the perpetuity's cost or its present value.
As per the data, we have the following inputs:
Annual cash flows = $5,000
Time period = Infinite
Required return = 6%
In order to determine the cost of this perpetuity, we will use the following formula:
{eq}\text{Cost of a perpetuity} = \dfrac{\text{Annual cash flows}}{\text{Required Return}} = \dfrac{\$5,000}{6\%} = \$83,333.33 {/eq}
As we cannot determine the future value of a perpetuity, option D) is correct

d. Converting future cash flows in the their present value
Under discounting, future cash flows are multiplied by a discounting factor. The resulting value is called the present value of future cash flow. This technique is commonly used to judge the future viability of a project.
The other options are incorrect.
a.
Converting present value into its future value:
The process of converting a present cash flow into its future value is called compounding.
b.

The return on assets shows the average net income as a percentage of the average assets of the business. The projects are selected only if the return on assets is more than the required rate of return. It considers the net income and not the cash flows. It does not consider the time value of money.
The payback period computes the period required to recover the initial investment. It simply uses the expected cash flows. It does not consider the time value of money.

$32,270.4
The present cash flow of Investment Y is $32,270.4",Present Value: The cash value decreases as time passes; the present value signifies the same concept. It is an important aspect in calculating the money's worth. It discounts the cash value at the prevailing value.
46,"Say that the interest rate is 11% and you invest $200 today, and then another $220 exactly one year from today.",$490.62,$498.85,$511.15,$521.08,A,"The correct answer is
option a. $490.62.
Given information:
Total period of investment: 2 years
Interest rate: 11%
Investment 1 made at year 0: $200
Investment 2 made at year 1: $220
Step 1: Determine the future value of investment 1 as follows:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Future value 1} &=\text{Investment made at year 0}\times {{\left( 1+\text{Interest rate} \right)}^{\text{Time to maturity}}} \\ &=\$200\times {{\left( 1+11\% \right)}^{2}} \\ &=\$200\times 1.2321 \\ &=\$246.42 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Step 2: Determine the future value of investment 2 as follows:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Future value 2} &=\text{Investment made at year 1}\times {{\left( 1+\text{Interest rate} \right)}^{\text{Time to maturity}}} \\ &=\$220\times {{\left( 1+11\% \right)}^{1}} \\ &=\$244.20 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Step 3: Determine the total future value:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Total future value} &=\text{Future value 1}+\text{Future value 2} \\ &=\$246.42+\$244.20 \\ &=\$490.62 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Note: The second investment is made exactly one year after the first investment. The total investment period is two years. So, the interest rate on the second investment will be paid only for the remaining one year.",Savings: Individuals often allocate a portion of their income to savings in order to meet future financial needs. Savings refer to the amount of money set aside from one's income. These savings can be accumulated over time and invested whenever there is an excess of income.
47,"At an effective annual interest rate of 20 percent, how many years will it take a given amount to triple in value?",5 years,6 years,8 years,10 years,B,"The correct answer is
option B) 6 years.
Given information:
Effective annual interest rate: 20%
Apply the formula used to calculate the length of time a present value needs to reach a certain future value at a given interest rate.
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Number of years}&=\frac{\ln \left( \frac{\text{Future value}}{\text{Present value}} \right)}{\ln \left( 1+\text{Effective annual interestrate} \right)} \\ &=\frac{\ln \left( \frac{\$1\times 3}{\$1} \right)}{\ln \left( 1+20\% \right)} \\ &=\frac{\ln \left( 3 \right)}{\ln \left( 1.20 \right)} \\ &=\frac{1.10}{0.18} \\ &=6\ \text{years} \end{aligned} {/eq}
Thus, the number of years is 6 years.
Note: The present value is assumed to be $1. Thus, the future value is triple of $1, that is, $3 (1*3).
The value of 'ln' can be determined using a log table.",Log Value: A log value is obtained as a result of applying the mathematical function of logarithm to a given number or value. The logarithmic function measures the power to which a given base must be raised to produce a certain value.
48,If {eq}8\% {/eq} is compounded quarterly for 3 years then the interest rate (r) for a single period used in a time-value money calculation would be:,{eq}4\% {/eq}.,{eq}3\% {/eq}.,{eq}8\% {/eq}.,{eq}2\% {/eq}.,D,"The correct answer is option
d. {eq}2\% {/eq}.
The interest rate for a single period is computed as follows:
{eq}\begin{align*} &= \dfrac{\text{Quoted annual interest rate}}{\text{Number of quarters in a year}} \\[0.3 cm] &= \dfrac{8\%}{4} \\[0.3 cm] &= 2\% \end{align*} {/eq}",Time Value of Money: The concept of the time value of money is used to ascertain the expected future value of a deposit made today or the investment supposed to be made today for a predetermined future value. The factors relevant for the computations are periodic interest rate and number of periods.
49,Discounting:,expresses the present in the future,brings the future back to the present,is synonymous with compounding,depends on the rate of interest,B,"The correct answer is option
B. brings the future back to the present
.
The discounting process is used to bring the future value back to its equivalent present value. It takes into consideration the relevant discount rate or interest rate and the timing of the future cash flow.",Time Value of Money: The concept of the time value of money is used to compute the equivalent future worth of a deposit made today or the equivalent present worth of an expected future cash flow. One can even ascertain the time required for an investment to grow to a certain value.
50,Which of the following describes the time value of money?,Money loses it purchasing power over time through inflation.,A dollar received today is worth more than a dollar to be received in the future.,The time value of money has no effect on the timing of capital investments.,The fact that invested cash may not earn interest over time is called time value of money.,B,"The correct option is
b. A dollar received today is worth more than a dollar to be received in the future.
The concept of the time value of money states that the value of money is not absolute and it changes with time. The value of a sum of money today is more than the value of the same sum of money at some point in the future. The reason for the same is interest rates, inflation, opportunity costs, etc.",Financial Mathematics: Financial mathematics is the study of finances. There are various concepts used in financial mathematics. The concept of the time value of money is one of them.
