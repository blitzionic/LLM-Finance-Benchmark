4,The company cost of capital is the return investors would require on a portfolio of the company's:,debt securities only,equity securities only,debt and equity securities mixed in the same way as the company's capital structure.,debt and equity securities mixed equally regardless of the company's capital structure.,C,"Correct answer is Option c.
The capital structure includes all the long-term sources of financing. Hence, all these sources must be included while computing the cost of capital.
This cost of capital is calculated by adding the weighted costs of each source. These weights are the same as the proportions in which the sources are present in the capital structure.
Thus, cost of capital of company is the return investors would require on a portfolio of the debt and equity securities of the company mixed in the same way as its capital structure.
Explanation for incorrect answers:

An increase in the tax rate will lower the after-tax cost of debt. Hence, the WACC will decline consequently.
B) Incorrect. A change in the firm's capital structure will affect the weight of each capital component. Hence, it will change the firm's WACC.
C) Incorrect. The cost of debt should be assessed as an after-tax metric since the interest expense is deducted from the taxable income. Alternatively, the after-tax cost of debt is more relevant to reflect the actual financing cost of debt capital since it accounts for the effect of the interest tax shield.
D) Incorrect. Flotation costs reduce the net proceeds of a new issue of shares.

9,For which capital component must you make a tax adjustment when calculating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a firm?,Preferred stock.,Debt.,Equity.,,B,"The correct answer is
b) Debt
.
Options
Analysis
a. Preferred stock.
The dividends on preferred stock are fully taxable. So, there is no tax adjustment when calculating the WACC.
b. Debt.
The interest on debt is tax-deductible which reduces the after-tax cost of debt. Therefore, the cost of debt is subject to a tax adjustment.
c. Equity.
The dividends on common stock are fully taxable. So, there is no tax adjustment.","Weighted Average Cost of Capital: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is computed using the capital weights presented in the capital structure. The cost of each source of capital is multiplied by its weight in the capital structure, and the values are summed to arrive at the WACC."
10,The preferred capital structure weights to be used in the weighted average cost of capital are:,market weights.,nominal weights.,historic weights.,target weights.,A,"The answer is
a. market weights.
The weight for each capital component (common stock, preferred stock, and debt) should be estimated according to their market values. By using market values, it reflects the true economic value of each type of capital as of today while book values refer to historical costs.","Weighted Average Cost Of Capital: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is an average financing cost to the entire firm.

11,The overall (weighted average) cost of capital is composed of a weighted average of:,The cost of common equity and the cost of debt.,The cost of common equity and the cost of preferred stock.,The cost of preferred stock and the cost of debt.,"The cost of common equity, the cost of preferred stock, and the cost of debt.",D,"Option d
is the correct answer.
The major sources of capital for any business are equity, preferred stock, and debt. So, one should use the weighted average of all three of them to compute the proper cost of capital. Leaving either of them out would result in a misleading WACC. If one of these is not present, then one should use the weighted average of the other two.
All other options are wrong as one should use all three of them in computing WACC, i.e., equity, debt, and preferred stock.","Capital: Every business requires capital to expand its operations.

D) 60% debt, 15% preferred stock, and 25% common equity.
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):

According to the WACC formula, if the firm accounts for most debt in its capital structure, it will achieve a lower WACC since debt capital has the advantage of an interest tax shield. In addition, the cost of preferred stock is usually lower than the cost of common stock, which indicates that the firm can lower the WACC if it shifts common equity capital to preferred equity capital. Hence, if a firm's capital structure is raised mostly from selling bonds and preferred stocks, it will obtain a lower WACC.","Weighted Average Cost of Capital: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represents the firm's average financing cost, which includes the cost of common stock, the cost of preferred stock, and the cost of debt.

d. The after-tax cost of long-term debt is probably less than 10%.
Summary:
Return on total assets = 10%
Return on stockholders' equity = 12%
The weighted average cost of capital represents the firm's financing cost to fund its total assets. Thus, it can be treated as the required minimum rate of return on total assets. Since it is a weighted average figure, it will be between the after-tax cost of debt and the cost of equity.
Hence, the after-tax cost of debt should be lower than the return on total assets in this case.","Cost Of Debt: The cost of debt is a necessary component in estimating the firm's average cost of capital.

{eq}\text{Return on Investment} = \dfrac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Investment}}

{/eq}
As we can see that the above formula is independent of the minimum required rate of return and thus the return on investment will not change with the increase or decrease in the minimum required rate of return.
For Residual Income
{eq}\text{Residual Income} = \text{Net Income} - \text{(Average Investment * Minimum required rate of return)}

{/eq}
As the minimum required rate of return will increase, the amount to be subtracted will increase, and thus the residual income will decrease.",Minimum Required Rate of Return: The minimum required rate of return is the percentage that a business should earn on its investment to recover its costs and provide a return to investors. The minimum required rate of return is generally the cost of funds.
30,"All other inputs are constant, if a firm's tax rate decreases and they use debt in their capital structure, their WACC will _____.",increase,decrease,stay the same,,A,"The correct answer is
A. increase.
Weighted Average Cost Of Capital formula;
{eq}\text{WACC} = \displaystyle \text{Weight}_{equity} \times Cost_{equity} + \text{Weight}_{debt} \times Cost_{debt} \times (1 - \text{Tax rate}) {/eq}
It is obvious that a lower tax rate will raise the after-tax cost of debt. Thus, the firm's WACC will increase if all other inputs are constant.","Weighted Average Cost Of Capital (WACC): A firm's WACC is its financing cost to fund total assets, which considers the cost of equity and the cost of debt. Investors should acknowledge that the cost of the capital component should be the after-tax figure."
31,Tobin's Barbeque has a bank loan at 12% interest and an after-tax cost of debt of 6%. What will the after-tax cost of debt be when the loan is due if a new loan is taken out yielding 12%?,None of these options are true.,6%,11.05%,3.45%,B,"The correct answer is
option b. 6%.
Given information:
After-tax cost of debt = 6%
Cost of debt before tax = 12%
New cost of debt before tax = 12%
Step 1: Calculate the tax rate using the formula for the after-tax cost of debt:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{After-tax cost of debt} &=\text{Cost of debt before tax}\times \left( 1-\text{Tax rate} \right) \\ 6\% &=12\%\times \left( 1-\text{Tax rate} \right) \\ \left( 1-\text{Tax rate} \right) &=\frac{6\%}{12\%} \\ \left( 1-\text{Tax rate} \right) &=0.50 \\ \text{Tax rate} &=1-0.50 \\ &=0.50 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Step 2: Calculate the new after-tax cost of debt:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{New after-tax cost of debt} &=\text{New cost of debt before tax}\times \left( 1-\text{Tax rate} \right) \\ &=12\%\times \left( 1-0.50 \right) \\ &=12\%\times 0.50 \\ &=6\% \end{aligned} {/eq}
Thus, the new after-tax cost of debt will be 6%.",Cost of Debt: The cost of debt is the actual rate of interest that a business must pay on its long-term debt commitments and the minimum yield that lenders want to cover the potential capital loss when making the loan to a borrower.
32,"In computing the weighted average cost of capital, the preferred weighting scheme is generally based on the market values of each source of capital.",True,False,,,A,"The statement ""In computing the weighted average cost of capital, the preferred weighting scheme is generally based on the market values of each source of capital"" is
true
.
The WACC is computed by taking the weights and specific costs of components of the capital structure into account. The market value of the components is preferred in the computation because it reflects the true value and weights of the capital structure as of the present. It is more indicative and appropriate compared to the book value as the book value shows historical weights that may not be relevant today.","Weighted Average Cost of Capital: The weighted average cost of capital, generally referred to by its acronym WACC, is a metric that tells the cost of a firm's sources of funds. It shows the average cost that the firm has to bear to employ the various forms of capital in business operations."
33,Which of the following statements about the cost of capital is INCORRECT?,A company's target capital structure affects its weighted average cost of capital.,Weighted average cost of capital calculations should be based on the after-tax costs of all the individual capital components.,"If a company's tax rate increases, then, all else equal, its weighted average cost of capital will increase.",Flotation costs can increase the cost of preferred stock.,C,"The answer is
c. If a company's tax rate increases, then, all else equal, its weighted average cost of capital will increase.
a. This is a correct statement. The target capital structure affects the weight of each source of capital, which has a direct impact on the firm's weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
b. This is a correct statement. The after-tax cost of capital reflects the effective financing cost associated with each source of capital. Particularly, the use of the after-tax cost of debt is necessary for estimating the WACC since it accounts for the effects of the interest tax shield.
c. This is an incorrect statement. An increase in the corporate tax rate will lower the effective after-tax cost of debt. With that being said, the firm's weighted average cost of capital will decrease.
d. This is a correct statement. The flotation costs reduce the net proceeds from a new issue of stock, which raises the financing cost of stocks.","Weighted Average Cost Of Capital (WACC): The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the measure of the overall financing cost in the firm. The firm's WACC is affected by the cost of each source of capital, generally including equity capital and debt capital."
35,A company has a 10% coupon bond outstanding that is trading in the market at a yield to maturity of 9%. The company's marginal corporate tax rate is 40%. The cost of debt is closest to:,5.4%,6.0%,9.0%,10.0%,A,"The answer is
A. 5.4%
Summary:
Yield to maturity (YTM) = 9%
Marginal tax rate (T) = 40%
Determine the after-tax cost of debt:
After-tax cost of debt = Pretax cost of debt x (1 - T)
After-tax cost of debt = 9% x (1 - 40%)
After-tax cost of debt = 5.4%","Bonds: A bond is a debenture that a firm can issue to raise debt capital. The bond issuer needs to pay periodic interest to the bondholder. In addition, the bond's principal will return to the bondholder at the maturity."

C. add 3% to 6% to Kd.
In practice, the cost of equity can be determined by the bond-yield-plus-risk premium.
Cost of equity = Bond's yield + Equity risk premium
Bond's yield: Yield to maturity on the firm's outstanding bonds.
Equity risk premium: Empirically, the equity risk premium can range from 3% - 6%.","Cost Of Equity: The cost of equity indicates the financing cost to fund the firm's assets by shareholders' capital. Usually, the cost of equity is greater than the cost of debt since the cost of debt is reduced by the interest tax shield generated by interest expenses."

38,Everything else being equal a lower corporate tax rate:,will increase the WACC of a firm with debt and equity in its capital structure,will not affect the WACC of a firm with debt in its capital structure,will decrease the WACC of a firm with some debt in its capital structure,will decrease the WACC of a firm with only equity in its capital structure,A,"Recall that the weighted-average cost of capital is the sum of the weighted average cost of debt and the weighted average cost of equity, and the cost of debt is reduced by the income tax benefit it brings.
Let us discuss each alternative:
A. will increase the WACC of a firm with debt and equity in its capital structure.
This is the correct option. The cost of debt will increase when the corporate tax rate is lower because the income tax benefit from deducting interest will be less, and if the cost of the debt component is higher, the overall WACC will be higher
B. will not affect the WACC of a firm with debt in its capital structure
No, the cost of debt is affected by the income tax rate.
C. will decrease the WACC of a firm with some debt in its capital structure.
No, the weighted cost of debt would increase so the WACC will increase.
D. will decrease the WACC of a firm with only equity in its capital structure
No, income tax does not affect the cost of equity.","Weighted Average Cost of Capital: The weighted average cost of capital or WACC of a company is a formula used to determine the cost of the capital structure of a company.
