1,The numerator of the rate earned on common stockholders' equity ratio is,net income.,net income minus preferred dividends.,income before income tax.,operating income minus interest expense.,B,"The correct answer is option b. net income minus preferred dividends.
The rate earned on the common stockholders' equity ratio, also known as return on common stockholders' equity or return on equity (ROE), is a measure of a company's profitability and the efficiency with which it uses stockholders' equity to generate profits.
The formula for the rate earned on common stockholders' equity ratio is as follows:
{eq}\begin{align} \text{Rate of Return - Common Stock} &= \frac{\text{Net Income - Preferred Dividends}}{\text{Average Common Stockholders' Equity}} \\ \end{align} {/eq}
By subtracting the preferred dividends from net income, the ratio focuses on the earnings available to common stockholders, providing a measure of how effectively the company is generating returns for them.
Accordingly, the correct answer is option
b. net income minus preferred dividends.","Ratio Analysis: In management accounting, ratio analysis allows analysts, investors, and management to assess a company's profitability, liquidity, solvency, efficiency, and overall financial health."
2,Which of the following is not a liquidity ratio? Select one:,Current ratio,Quick ratio,Debt-to-equity ratio,Interest coverage ratio,C,"The correct answer can either be c. Debt-to-equity ratio or d. Interest coverage ratio.
A liquidity ratios measures the ability of the company to pay off its short-term debts as they become due using the company's current or quick assets. Thus, the current ratio and quick ratio are both liquidity ratios.
Now, let us explain the correct answers.
c. Debt-to-Equity Ratio: This is a solvency ratio, not a liquidity ratio. It measures the riskiness of a company's financial structure and its ability to meet long-term obligations.
d. Interest Coverage Ratio: This is also not a liquidity ratio; it is a solvency or profitability ratio that measures a company's ability to pay interest on its outstanding debt.","Financial Ratios: In accounting, financial ratios are often used for benchmarking, which involves comparing a company's financial performance with industry averages, direct competitors, or historical performance."
3,Which of the following ratios is the most useful one in assessing a firm's ability to service debts?,Fixed asset turnover.,Times interest earned ratio.,Gross profit margin.,Return on equity.,B,"a. Incorrect. The fixed asset turnover is an efficiency ratio that measures how the firm's fixed assets are operated to generate sales within a year.
b. Correct. The times interest earned ratio (TIE) is determined by dividing the firm's Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) by the interest expenses. With that being said, it indicates whether a firm can pay its financing costs by operating income.
c. Incorrect. Gross profit margin is a profitability ratio that measures the relationship between gross profit and the firm's sales.
d. Incorrect. Return on equity (ROE) is a profitability ratio. It is estimated by dividing the firm's net income by the total shareholders' equity capital. It is not a relevant ratio to measure the firm's ability to service debt.","Financial Ratios: An analysis of financial ratios is a necessary part of a fundamental analysis, which helps the firm's managers and investors to identify strengths and weaknesses through the financial statements. An analysis of financial ratios can be classified into 4 groups: liquidity, profitability, solvency and efficiency, and market prospect ratios."
4,What is the ratio that measures a firm's ability to repay both its short-and long-term debt?,Earnings per share.,Cash debt coverage ratio.,Cash flow to operating income ratio.,Cash flow per share.,B,"The correct option is
b. Cash debt coverage ratio.
A company's ability to service its debt, both current and future, using cash flow from operations is quantified by the cash debt coverage ratio, a financial metric. It reveals how comfortably a business can meet its debt payments with its current cash on hand. The ability of a company to generate enough cash to meet its debt obligations can be gauged by calculating this ratio, which compares cash flow from operations to the company's total debt.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
a. Earnings per share. A company's ability to repay debt is not directly reflected in its earnings per share, which measures profitability per share.
c. Cash flow to operating income ratio. The ratio of a company's cash flow from operations to its operating income does not take into account the company's ability to make debt payments.
d. Cash flow per share. A company's ability to repay its debts is not taken into account when calculating its cash flow per share.","Cash Equivalent: An asset that can be quickly and easily converted into cash is called a cash equivalent.

7,Which of the following is not an asset management ratio?,average collection period,days sales outstanding ratio,price-earnings ratio,inventory turnover ratio,C,"The correct answer is
option c. price-earnings ratio.
The price-earning (P/E) ratio is a valuation ratio. It is one of the methods that analysts and investors most frequently use to assess a stock's relative value. The P/E ratio aids in identifying an undervalued or overvalued stock. It exhibits the relationship between the firm's stock price and earnings per share. It signifies the quantum of money an investor is willing to invest in a single company's stock.
The explanation for the incorrect options:
Option a. Average collection period (ACP): The average collection period is an assets management ratio that gauges how long it typically takes a business to obtain money from consumers. The total accounts receivable are divided by the average daily credit sales to get the ACP.
Option b. Days sales outstanding ratio: Giving out products on credit is one approach to increase a company's profitability. Days sales outstanding are useful in keeping an eye on how long it will take the business owner to receive payment for products that were given out on credit.

8,A company has a cash ratio of 2.3. What does this imply?,The company has an unnecessarily large amount of cash supply.,The company does not have enough cash supply.,The company is not in a position to pay off its long-term liabilities.,The company is not in a position to pay off its current liabilities.,A,"The correct answer is
a. The company has an unnecessarily large amount of cash supply.
The cash ratio is the liquidity ratio. It is the ratio of cash and cash equivalents to the current liabilities of the company. A cash ratio greater than 1 indicates that the company has a cash supply greater than what is required to cover current liabilities. On the other hand, a cash ratio of less than 1 indicates that the cash supply is not sufficient to meet current liabilities.
In the given scenario, the cash ratio is 2.3, which indicates that the cash supply is too large, relative to what is required. It points toward inefficient cash management.
The other options are incorrect.
b.
The company does not have enough cash supply:
The cash ratio of 2.3 indicates that the company has enough cash supply.
c.
The company is not in a position to pay off its long-term liabilities:
The cash ratio does not measure the ability of the company to repay long-term liabilities.
d.
The company is not in a position to pay off its current liabilities:
The cash ratio of the company is greater than 1. Thus, it is in a position to pay off its current liabilities.","Financial Ratios: Financial ratios are the metrics calculated using the information reported in the financial statements.

15,Which ratios help assess the firm's ability to meet cash needs as they arise?,Current ratio and cash flow liquidity ratio.,Average collection period and net profit margin.,Debt ratio and dividend payout.,Operating profit margin and return on equity.,A,"The correct answer is option a. Current ratio and cash flow liquidity ratio.
These two ratios help assess a firm's ability to meet its cash needs as they arise. The current ratio measures a company's short-term liquidity by comparing its current assets to its current liabilities. The cash flow liquidity ratio (a cash flow to current liabilities ratio) compares a company's cash flow from operations to its current liabilities, emphasizing the firm's ability to generate cash from its operations to meet its short-term obligations. Both ratios provide insight into a firm's capacity to pay off its short-term liabilities and address immediate cash needs.

Incorrect. A quick ratio is a liquidity ratio that messes with the firm's ability to cover its current liabilities with its current assets.
b. Correct. The quick ratio is more relevant to assess a firm's liquidity since it excludes the inventory. Inventory is the less liquid current asset among a firm's different types of current assets.
c. Incorrect. Accounts receivable is included in the estimate of the two liquidity ratios.
d. Incorrect. To measure how quickly cash flows through the firm, an investor should determine the cash turnover. The curernt ratio and quick ratio are to measure the firm's liquidity in a short-term.","Liquidity Ratios: A firm's liquidity ratios include the following two ratios: current ratio and quick ratio. For a firm with strong liquidity, these two ratios should be greater than 1 to reserve the fact that all current assets can be converted into cash to cover the firm's liabilities."

a. a firm's ability to meet short-term financial obligations.
The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
a. a firm's ability to meet short-term financial obligations.
This is the correct alternative because the liquidity ratios such as the current and quick ratios compare a company's current assets to its current liabilities.
b. how efficiently a firm is allocating its liabilities.
The use of liabilities to generate profit is measured by the leverage ratio.
c. the return on assets.
The return on assets is measured by the return on assets ratio, not the liquidity ratios.
d. the profitability of the firm.

18,A company's current ratio must always equal or exceed its acid-test ratio.,TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The correct answer is
option a. True
In the computation of the current ratio, the numerator includes all the current assets that a company owns, and the denominator consists of its current liabilities. In the computation of the acid-test ratio, the numerator consists of only cash equivalents and bills receivable for the period, and the denominator remains the same as before. This decrease in items in the numerator of the acid test ratio always makes the current ratio higher than the acid test ratio. Hence, it is
true
to state that a company's current ratio must always equal or exceed its acid-test ratio.","Liquidity Ratio: Liquidity ratios measure the ability of a company in tackling its short-term liabilities using its current assets. These include the current ratio, cash ratio, acid-test ratio, etc."
19,Asset liability management is a formal process to ensure _____.,that borrowings are limited to what is needed,that loans are made at the best interest rates possible,a bank has steps that it can take if a liquidity crisis develops,that steps are taken to ensure the highest level of checking accounts,C,"The correct answer is
c. a bank has steps that it can take if a liquidity crisis develops.
Asset liability management is the process of ensuring the organization will have enough liquid assets to convert into cash to cover withdrawals. Low-risk investments such as savings accounts and money market accounts pay lower rates of interest compared to the interest rates associated with higher-risk securities. Financial organizations will typically use funds such as these from investors to make loans or to engage in other activities that may not be liquid. The organizations are still required to have the ability to cover withdrawals and need to properly manage how much of their portfolio becomes tied up in illiquid holdings. Managers can often predict a normal rate of withdrawal, but must also be ready to weather a run on the institution if financial conditions change and more investors want to convert their holdings back into cash. Organizations that fail to properly manage their asset-liability can quickly collapse or lose great sums of money if they need to rush to convert illiquid assets into cash at discounted rates.
The other answers all discuss policies to properly manage the portfolio of the organization. However, none of these are the definition of asset liability management.",Liquid Assets: Liquid assets include cash or other securities that can be quickly converted into cash. Certain commodities such as gold and silver are highly liquid assets that can quickly be exchanged. Securities such as real estate are less liquid and require greater periods of time to sell and convert into cash if required.
20,A common measure of liquidity is:,the ratio of sales to assets.,dividends per share of common stock.,the accounts receivable turnover.,the profit margin.,C,"The correct answer is option c. the accounts receivable turnover.
Liquidity measures the ability of a company to convert its assets into cash quickly and meet its short-term obligations. For example, accounts receivable turnover is a financial ratio that assesses how effectively a company collects payments from its customers. A higher turnover ratio indicates better liquidity, showing that the company can quickly manage its receivables.
Incorrect Options
a. The ratio of sales to assets:
This is known as the Asset Turnover Ratio. It measures a company's efficiency in utilizing its assets to generate revenue.

22,Which of these is not a liquidity ratio?,Asset turnover,Accounts receivable turnover,Inventory turnover,Current ratio,A,"The correct answer is option A. Asset turnover.
Asset turnover is not a liquidity ratio. An efficiency or activity ratio measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales. On the other hand, liquidity ratios, like the current ratio, measure a company's ability to meet short-term obligations. Accounts receivable and inventory turnover ratios can also be considered activity ratios as they measure how efficiently a company manages its receivables and inventory. So, accounts receivable turnover, inventory turnover, and current ratio are all considered liquidity ratio.

The price-earnings ratio, commonly referred to as the ""price-to-earnings or P/E ratio,"" is a financial metric that evaluates the performance of a company relative to its share price. It is computed by dividing the price of a share by earnings (on a per-share basis). This ratio can be viewed as a value indicator, such that a company with a high P/E ratio can be viewed as overvalued and vice versa.
Other options are incorrect.
Option a. The average collection period: It is incorrect because the formulation of the ratio involves the inclusion of average receivables, which is a current asset of a company.
Option b. Inventory turnover ratio: It is incorrect because, as the name suggests, the computation of this ratio factors in the inventory as well, which is a current asset of a company.
Option d. Fixed asset turnover ratio: This is a financial ratio that measures the revenue-generating ability of the assets employed by a firm. It measures the efficiency of assets employed.","Ratio Analysis: Ratio analysis is a metric used to evaluate a company s financial performance, operational efficiency, solvency, liquidity, and overall position.

The formula associated with a firm's cash ratio can be written as follows:
{eq}\rm Cash~ratio = \frac{\text{Cash and cash equivalents}}{\text{Current liabilities }} {/eq}
This means that the cash ratio represents the percentage of current liabilities that can be paid off using cash that is already on hand.
The quick ratio is the second most stringent and is defined by the following relation:
{eq}\begin{align} \text{Quick ratio} &= \frac{\text{Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses}}{\text{Current liabilities }} \\ \end{align} {/eq}
The quick ratio therefore considers current assets like accounts receivable that can be converted to cash promptly to be available as well to cover current liabilities.
The current ratio is the least strict liquidity ratio because it uses all the current assets, including inventory, to be available to settle current liabilities. Its formula is:
{eq}\begin{align} \text{Current ratio} &= \frac{\text{Current assets}}{\text{Current liabilities }} \\ \end{align} {/eq}",Liquidity Ratios: A company's liquidity ratios are used to indicate its ability to pay its short-term debts and operating expenses. It is an important financial indicator because poor cash flow and cash management reduce any company's ability to generate returns for investors.
27,". Darlene Corporation has $300,000 in assets, 30 percent of which are current, and $100,000 in liabilities, 40 percent of which are current. Which of the following is true?",Darlene's current ratio is 3 to 1.,"Darlene's working capital is $200,000.","Darlene's working capital is $50,000.",The current ratio and working capital are measures of a company's profitability.,C,"To answer this question, let's first calculate Darlene Corporation's current assets, current liabilities, current ratio, and working capital.
For Current Assets
Current Assets = Total Assets * (Percentage of Current Assets)
Current Assets = $300,000 * 30%
Current Assets = $90,000
So, the total current asset is equivalent to $90,000.
For Current Liabilities
Current Liabilities = Total Liabilities * (Percentage of Current Liabilities)
Current Liabilities = $100,000 * 40%
Current Liabilities = $40,000
For current Ratio
The current ratio is computed as follows.
{eq}\begin{align} \text{Current Ratio} &= \frac{\text{Total Current Asset}}{\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\ &= \frac{\$90,000}{\text{\$40,000}} \\ &= 2.25 \end{align} {/eq}
So, it means that the current ratio is equivalent to 2.25.
For Working Capital
Working capital is computed based on the difference between the total current assets and total current liabilities.
Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
Working Capital = $90,000 - $40,000
Working Capital = $50,000
So,
the total working capital is $50,000.

$$\text{Days' Sales in Inventory} = \frac{\text{Average Inventory}}{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}} \times \text{Number of Days in Period} $$
This calculation tells us the average number of days it takes for a company to sell its inventory over a given period of time.
We want to determine the days' sales in inventory for the scenario provided in the question. The problem provides the following information needed to implement our formula:
Average Inventory = $30,000
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = $960,000
Since a period is not specified, we can assume it is a year. Hence, the number of days in our period is 365.
Plugging these values into our formula and evaluating, we get the following:
$$\begin{align} \text{Days' Sales in Inventory} &= \frac{\text{Average Inventory}}{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}} \times \text{Number of Days in Period}\\[0.3cm] &= \frac{\$30,000}{\text{\$960,000}} \times 365\\[0.3cm] &= \text{11.40625 days} \end{align} $$

b. The average collection period will go down.
The average collection period is calculated as 365 divided by the accounts receivable turnover ratio. So, it can be said that the average collection period has an inverse relationship with the accounts receivable turnover ratio.
On the other hand, the accounts receivable turnover ratio is the ratio of credit sales and average accounts receivable. So, if credit sales go up and accounts receivable stay the same, the accounts receivable turnover ratio increases because credit sale is the numerator of the ratio. Due to this increase in the accounts receivable turnover ratio, the average collection period is reduced (owing to the inverse relationship with accounts receivable turnover).
The other options are incorrect.
a. The average collection period will go up: The average collection period goes up if accounts receivable turnover decreases. However, here, the accounts receivable remain the same, and credit sales increase. So, the accounts receivable turnover increases.
c. Accounts receivable turnover will decrease: Accounts receivable turnover decreases when credit sales go down or average creditors increase.

Firm morale, being a non-financial factor, cannot be directly measured through financial ratios. It comprises the overall emotional well-being, motivation, and job satisfaction of employees within a firm. It is a subjective concept. A combination of measures such as employee surveys, employee turnover and retention ratios, feedback, performance appraisals, and other engagement activities can be used to measure a firm's morale.
The other options are incorrect because:
Option a: Comparing the firm's performance against its peers: Financial ratios are valuable tools for comparing a firm's performance with that of its competitors. By examining key ratios, such as the net profit margin, a firm can assess its relative profitability in comparison to its industry peers. For instance, a firm has a net profit margin of 15 percent and its competitor achieves 18 percent. This comparison prompts the firm to investigate the factors contributing to its lower margins. It enables the firm to identify areas for improvement and take appropriate actions to enhance profitability.
Option c: Comparing the efficiency of different teams within the firm: Financial ratios can also be utilized to evaluate the efficiency of different departments within the same firm. For instance, consider a firm with two divisions: one responsible for producing biscuits and the other for producing beverages. By examining the inventory turnover ratio, which is 5 times for the biscuit division and 2 times for the beverage division, a comparison can be made. This analysis helps the firm identify areas of inefficiency within the beverage division, allowing for targeted improvements to enhance its inventory management and overall operational efficiency.
Option d: Measuring the firm's performance through time: Financial ratios are instrumental in comparing a firm's financial performance across different periods. By examining changes in ratios, such as return on equity (ROE), a firm can gain insights into its progress over time.
