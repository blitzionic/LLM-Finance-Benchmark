1,Assume that USA interest rate is 6%; Mexico interest rate is 2%; spot rate now is $0.50/Peso; spot rate one year later is $0.51/Peso. Find the uncovered return from the USA point of view.,5.12%,3.71%,8.16%,4.04%,C,"The closest answer is c. 8.16%.  Support is below.
The peso is expected to appreciate relative to the dollar.  Specifically, it is expected to gain 2.00% ($.51 / $.50 = .02).  This equates to a loss of 1.96% for USD investors ((1/.51)/(1/.50) -1 = .0196)
So, for a U.S. investor borrowing in pesos and investing in USD, he can expect to pay interest of 2% on the peso, earn interest of 6.00% on the USD, and gain 2.00% of value on the exchange rate.  Specifically, the uncovered return is as follows:
Uncovered Return = .06 - .02 - .02 = .08","Uncovered Return: When dealing with international investments and foreign currency exchange, an uncovered return is that which is attainable without any hedging maneuvers to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations."
2,The holding period return on a stock is equal to __________.,the capital gain yield over the period plus the inflation rate.,the capital gain yield over the period plus the dividend yield.,the current yield plus the dividend yield.,the dividend yield plus the risk premium.,B,"Correct answer is Option b.
The Holding period return gives the entire return that is earned on an investment from the beginning till the time it is sold. Thus, it includes both the dividends received and the gain on sale of stock.
Thus, HPR is equal to the capital gain yield over the period plus the dividend yield.
Explanation for incorrect answers:
a. It is incorrect because HPR does not take inflation into account.
c. It is incorrect because current yield is equal to the dividend yield itself and the capital gains yield is not included in this case.
d. It is incorrect because risk premium is already a part of the required return on stock and capital gains yield is not included in this case as well.",Capital gains yield: Capital gains yield refers to the return that is earned as result of sale of an asset. It is expressed in percentage. It arises only when the value of asset at the time of sale is greater than the value of asset at the time of its purchase.

6,Suppose you bought a bond with an annual coupon rate of 7.2% one year ago for $895. The bond sells for $922 today.,"Assuming a $1,000 face value, what was your total dollar return on this investment over the past year? (Do not round intermediate calculations and round your answer to the nearest whole number, e.g., 32.)","What was your total nominal rate of return on this investment over the past year? (Do not round intermediate calculations and enter your answer as a percent rounded to 2 decimal places, e.g., 32.16.)","If the inflation rate last year was 4.2%, what was your total real rate of return on this investment? (Do not round intermediate calculations and enter your answer as a percent rounded to 2 decimal places, e.g., 32.16.)",,A,"a. Total dollar return is $99.
Total dollar return is the sum of interest payment and capital gain. Given 1000 face value and 7.2% annual coupon, since the bond is held for one year, you would have received only one coupon payment = 1000 * 7.2% = 72. When the bond is sold, the capital gain = sale price - purchase price = 922 - 895 = 27.
Hence, total dollar return = 72 + 27 = 99.
b. Nominal rate of return = total dollar return / purchase price = 99 / 895 = 11.06%.
c. Real rate of return = nominal rate of return - inflation rate = 11.06% - 4.2% = 6.86%.","Holding Period Return: The holding period is the period between when an asset is purchased and when the asset is sold.

The answer is D.
The total dollar return is the sum of dividend, which is $1, and capital gains, which is 29 - 20 = $9. That is, total dollar return = 9 + 1 = 10. The holding period return is the ratio of total dollar return to initial investment, i.e.,

10,"The realized rate of return, or holding period return, is equal to the holding period dollar gain divided by the price at the beginning of the period.",True,False,,,A,"The provided description is
true
.
Concerning the meaning of holding a period return or realized return, it specifies the total return an investor earns from their investment portfolio within a specified period of holding those investments or assets.
Computing the realized return with a percentage approach, the realized return is first analyzed by evaluating the difference between the ending value and the beginning value of investments. Afterwards, the amount realized is divided by the initial investment value and multiplied by 100. Thus, the provided statement is appropriate and true.","Investment Income: Investment income is the revenue or profit derived from financial accounts or assets. There are three main forms capital gains, interest, and dividends.

For a debt security that does not pay coupons, a discount instrument, the only way to recognize earnings over the life of the debt is to accrue the interest.
The other answer choices are incorrect due to the reasons outlined below.
a. An investment's earnings can grow by less than ten percent to yield positive results.
b. An investment can generate positive nominal results without exceeding the rate of inflation.  It must exceed the rate of inflation to generate real positive results.
d. An investment can generate positive results, even though its documentation may be inappropriate.","HPR: HPR stands for holding period return, which is the rate of return generated by an investment over the time period in which it is held.

12,You buy an 8 year $1000 par value bond today that has a 6% yield and a 6% annual payment coupon. In one year promised yields have risen to 7%. Your one year holding period return was:,0.61%,-5.39%,1.28%,-3.25%,A,"The answer is A. 0.61%.  Rationale is below.
At Year 0, we know the bond price must have been $1,000, because the 6% coupon matched the 6% yield to maturity.
We can most efficiently compute the bond's price at Year 1 by using a financial calculator, such as a Texas Instruments BAII Plus Professional.
For Year 1, input the following values:
I/Y = 7.0%
FV = $1,000.00
PMT = $60.00
N = 8 - 1 = 7
Compute for PV to get a price of $946.11.
Now, we can compute the holding period return (HPR), which is illustrated below.
HPR = (Interest Income + Year 1 Price - Year 0 Price) / Year 0 Price
HPR = ($60 + $946.11 - $1,000) / $1,000 = .0061 or .61%",HPR: HPR is short for holding period return.  It is a measure that indicates the total return (income plus price appreciation/depreciation) earned over the holding period for an investment.

19,"You purchased the stock of Sargent Motors at a price of $75.75 one year ago today. If you sell the stock today for $89.00, what is your holding period return?",35.00%,12.50%,17.50%,25.00%,C,"Correct answer: Option C) 17.50%.
Explanation:
Holding period return = (Selling price - Purchase price) / Purchase price
Holding period return = ($89 - $75.75) / $75.75
Holding period return = 17.49%",Holding Period Return: The holding period return is the return that an investor can realize by holding the investment for a certain time period without selling it. The percentage is equal to the ratio of the return realized relative to the purchase price of the investment.
20,"If you invest $3,600 in Dell Stock and 7 years later the stock is worth $10,300, what has been your Total Holding Period Percentage Return?",650%,186%,1.86%,6.5%,B,"The correct answer is option B) 186%.
Given information:
Dell stock investment = $3,600
Dell stock worth after 7 years = $10,300
The total holding period percentage return can be calculated using the information given. The computation is as follows:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm{HPR}} &= \frac{{{\rm{I}} + \left( {{\rm{EV}} - {\rm{BV}}} \right)}}{{{\rm{BV}}}}\\ &= \frac{{\$ 0 + \left( {\$ 10,300 - \$ 3,600} \right)}}{{\$ 3,600}}\\ &= \frac{{\$ 6,700}}{{\$ 3,600}}\\ &= 1.86\end{align*} {/eq}
Here,
HPR = Holding Period Return
I = Income from the stock's dividend
EV = Ending value or worth of the stock
BV= Beginning value of the stock
Since no information regarding the dividend (income) received is given in the question, the income is assumed as 0.
Now, the holding period return is 1.86, but in the question, the total holding period percentage return is asked that would be 1.86*100 = 186%.
Therefore,
the total holding period percentage return is 186%.",Holding Period Return: The holding period return is a criterion used to determine the worth of investing in the stock for a duration. It computes the amount a stock is offering to keep it in the portfolio for a period.

For a debt security that does not pay coupons, a discount instrument, the only way to recognize earnings over the life of the debt is to accrue the interest.
The other answer choices are incorrect due to the reasons outlined below.
a. An investment's earnings can grow by less than ten percent to yield positive results.
b. An investment can generate positive nominal results without exceeding the rate of inflation.  It must exceed the rate of inflation to generate real positive results.
d. An investment can generate positive results, even though its documentation may be inappropriate.","HPR: HPR stands for holding period return, which is the rate of return generated by an investment over the time period in which it is held.  The return comes from two sources - income received and price appreciation/depreciation."
25,The holding period return should not be used when analyzing investments with unequal holding periods.,True,False,,,A,"The statement is
TRUE.
Unequal holding periods between investments make the benchmarking being inconsistent because a longer holding period will generate higher total return.

It is estimated by total cash inflows divided by investment's initial cash outlay, represented in form of percentage."
26,"If the annual earnings for a company are $30, the expected future price of its stock is $100, and the required rate of return is 30%, then the current price of the stock should be",$97.,$100.,$130.,$169.,B,"The answer is b.
Assume that the annual earnings are all paid out as dividends, then the current dividends yield on the stock is:
30 / 100 = 30%.
We know that the total return on the investment is the sum of dividend yield and expected capital gain, i.e.,
total required return = dividend yield + expected capital gain
Given that required return is 30%, and current dividend yield is 30%, it implies that the expected capital gain is 0.
We further know that the expected future price of the stock is 100, given that expected capital gain is 0, the current price must be the same as the expected future price, i.e., 100.","Asset Return: Investments in an asset yields returns in two ways: (1) the asset can provide periodic yields such as interest from bonds and dividends from stocks; (2) the asset might appreciate in price, thereby generating capital gains.
