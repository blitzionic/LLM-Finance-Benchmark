1,"If the employee has $300 withheld from her check for FICA-OASDI, what is the amount that the employer would need to pay?",300,100,0,400,A,"The correct option is A. 300.
The employer must pay FICA taxes that are exactly the same as the amount that it deducts from the wages of its employees.

3,The employer is responsible for which of the following payroll taxes?,6.2% Social Security,1.45% Medicare tax,Federal and state unemployment taxes,All of the above,D,"Answer choice:
d.  All of the above
Explanation:
The employer is responsible for half of the social security taxes (6.2%) and half of the medicare taxes (1.45%).  The other half is paid by the employee.  Also, federal and state unemployment taxes are the responsibility of the employer but the employer only pays these taxes up to the wage base.",Payroll Taxes: When companies hire individuals as employees they must withhold certain payroll taxes from the employees checks and they must pay some of the payroll taxes for their employees.

4,"Although most of the burden of social security payroll tax is paid by both employers and employees, most of the burden would actually fall on employees.",True,False,,,A,"True.
It is true that although most of the burden of the social security payroll tax is paid by both employers and employees, a larger chunk of the burden is borne by employees. This is because of the influence of tax incidence by markets, not by the law. Therefore, as changes occur in the market, employees tend to carry more tax burden because the person required to pay a tax may be different from the bearer of the tax burden, owing to the market system. Due to the market's control of the tax burden, employers lower their burden by reducing workers' wages so that they do not feel the burden of paying the taxes but instead pay them by reducing employees' wages. Even after the workers' wages are reduced, their share of the payroll tax is deducted from their already-low wages. Therefore, more payroll tax burden is borne by employees.",Taxation: Taxation refers to the imposition of mandatory levies on citizens of a country by its government. Failing to pay taxes as required by the government is known as tax evasion and is punishable by law. The government receives tax payments from taxpayers to raise revenue for use in state and community projects.
5,"In 2015, Lew earned wages of $384,828.",What is the amount of Social Security tax withheld from his salary?,What is the amount of Medicare tax withheld from his salary?,,,A,"Requirement a.
To determine the Social Security tax in 2015, consider the tax rate, which is 6.2%, and the wage base limit of $118,500. Since Lew had earned more than that, the Social Security tax would equal the wage base limit times the tax rate.
{eq}\begin{align}

\text{Social Security tax} &= \text{Wage base limit x Tax rate} \\

6,For which of the following taxes is there no ceiling on the amount of employee annual earnings subject to the tax?,Only federal withholding tax,Only Social Security tax,Only unemployment compensation tax,None of the above,A,"Answer choice:
a. Only federal withholding tax
Explanation:
There is no ceiling on the amount of employee annual earnings subject to federal income tax. That means regardless of how much an employee earns it is subject to federal income tax. In contrast, wages of up to $137,700 are taxed for social security taxes. The ceiling for earnings subject to unemployment tax is dependent upon the state.",Payroll Tax: During the payroll process there are different taxes that are withheld from employees checks and there are taxes that the employer has to pay.

A. federal income tax, social security tax, medicare tax, and FUTA
Federal Income Taxes are determined by one's income. Depending on how much money is earned, the employee will fall into a certain tax bracket.
Social Security Tax is 6.2% of an employee's income. This is used for paying benefits of social security.
Medicare Tax is 1.45% of an employee's income. This is used for funding the Medicare health system in the United States for senior citizens and individuals with disabilities.
FUTA is the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. This is used for unemployment payments and other work-related funds.
State and local taxes are not required by the federal law. Their amounts and usage are determined by each state and municipality. Although the federal government can enact laws that impact state and local taxes, it is mainly controlled by states and municipalities.","Federal Taxes: Federal taxes are taken out of one's income to be used to fund government projects. Some things that federal taxes are used for are military, national debt, education, and scientific research, among many other operations. Penalties and compound interest on unpaid amounts will be charged for any outstanding balances for federal tax payments."

Explanation:
A withholding allowance is about how much income tax should be deducted by an employer from an employee's payroll. To claim that allowance form w-4 is used.

a. Charitable contribution from employees.
We are asked to identify the item that is NOT an additional company expense. The table below analyzes the options.
a. Charitable contribution from employees.
This is the correct alternative because charitable contributions from employees are simply deducted from their earnings and paid to the charity instead of to the employee. The company does not incur any additional expenses.
b. Pension benefit costs.
Pensions offered as a fringe benefit to employees are an additional cost on top of the gross earnings for employees.
c. Employer FICA.
This is another additional expense because employers must pay additional FICA taxes equal to the amounts paid by employees.
d. Unemployment tax.
Unemployment tax is also an additional expense for the company because it is an employer payroll tax.","Payroll Expenses: The largest payroll expense is the gross earnings of employees. However, employers incur various additional payroll-related expenses because of benefits offered to employees and employer payroll taxes imposed on them."

13,Employers who do not deduct statutory withholdings from employee payments have nothing to worry about.,True,False,,,B,"The above-stated statement is false.
Explanation:
There are two types of deductions:
1) compulsory deductions and
2) voluntary deductions.
Voluntary deductions can be deducted from an employee's salary only if the deduction is approved by the employee or is optional. Various penalties apply depending on national regulations if a compulsory deduction must be made and the employer fails to make the deduction. In the united states,
the trust fund recovery penalty may apply if federal income, social security, or Medicare taxes are required to be withheld or aren't deposited or paid to the U.S. Treasury.
The penalty is 100% of the unpaid trust fund tax. If these due taxes can't be immediately collected from the employer or business, then the trust fund recovery penalty may be imposed on all persons who the IRS determines is to be responsible for collecting, accounting for, or paying over these taxes,
The penalty is a non-tax deductible expense that will reduce the net income by that much amount.","Deduction: It is an expense deductible from taxable income to reduce the amount payable and is different from a tax credit, which is deducted from the amount of tax payable rather than from your reported income."

Currently, the FICA tax rate is 7.65% (comprises of 6.20% allocated to social security and 1.45% allocated to Medicare), in which the employer and employee equally contribute.
Explanation for the incorrect options:
Option a. It is incorrect because LFRA is not deducted from the employee's salary.
Option c. It is incorrect because employers cannot withhold the amount for unemployment taxes.","Employers: Employers are those individuals who recruit different individuals and assign the work as per their skills and talents. In return for their work, the employers provide them compensation and other perquisites as per their work profile."
