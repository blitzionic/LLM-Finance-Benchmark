1,The income tax base for an individual tax return is:,Adjusted gross income.,Gross income.,Adjusted gross income minus AGI deductions.,Realized income from whatever source derived.,C,"The correct option is
c. Adjusted gross income minus AGI deductions.
The income tax base for an individual tax return is calculated based on the adjusted gross income (AGI) minus AGI deductions. Adjusted gross income is the amount left over after tax-deductible expenses and other deductions have been subtracted from gross income. Interest on loans, money put away for retirement, and self-employment taxes are all eligible for this category of deductions. The income tax base, which is determined by subtracting an individual's AGI deductions, is the sum that is used to compute their income tax liability.
Explanation for other options:
a. Adjusted gross income: Income tax bases are determined in large part by deductions, which are ignored by calculating adjusted gross income alone.
b. Gross income: Income tax bases are incorrectly estimated when using gross income because it does not take into account any adjustments or deductions.
d. Realized income from whatever source derived: The phrase ""realized income from whatever source derived"" is too general and does not include all of the necessary deductions and adjustments for computing an individual's taxable income.","Tax Structure: The government needs the money to run the country. So there is a mechanism in the country that issues, implements,  and controls tax laws. The purpose is to get the maximum amount to be spent on expenditures."
2,Which of the following is an example of an activity-based tax?,An excise tax.,A tax based on business net income.,A gift tax on the transfer of assets.,None of the above.,B,"The correct answer is b. A tax based on business net income.
This is because the income tax is based on the economic activity generated by the business (e.g. the amount of sales realized, the amount of expenses deducted, etc.)",What Is Income Tax: A company's Income Tax expense is reported on the income statement on a separate line item. The Income Tax expense will usually vary based on the jurisdictions where the income was earned and the tax rates on business income.
3,Tax incidence is primarily determined by the market participant who pays tax to the government.,True,False,,,A,"The above statement is True.
Tax incidence refers to how a given tax affects each individual who must pay it. The lost utility or welfare is used to calculate the real cost of a tax imposed by the government. The method used to distribute the tax burden between purchasers and sellers is known as tax incidence.
Market participants play an important role in the tax incidence. Market participants are the institutions, investors, etc. It is important to pay taxes set by the government.
Taxes may be imposed depending on how elastic supply and demand are in terms of price. Buyers are often on the hook for taxes when supply is more elastic than demand.
The term ""incidence of a tax"" describes the degree to which a person or organization is adversely affected by applying a tax; this impact might be felt by either the consumer or the producer. Taxation's ""burden"" is another name for the incidence. According to the price, the incidence changes the price elasticity of demand.
Therefore, it is true that the market player who pays the tax to the government has the most influence on tax incidence.","Market Participant: Market participants are another name for economic agents, actors, and more especially decision makers in models of many aspects of the economy. In partial equilibrium models of a single market, buyers and sellers are two typical agents."
4,A sale of $600 on account subject to a sales tax of 5% would increase account receivable by $570.,True,False,,,B,"The statement is
b) False
.
The value of sales is $600, and it is subject to a 5% sales tax. The total amount to be collected from the customer is the sales value, including sales tax.
Debit to Accounts Receivable = Sales × (1 + Sales tax rate)
Debit to Accounts Receivable = $600 × (1 + 5%)
Debit to Accounts Receivable = $630
The customer should pay sales tax, not the seller. However, the seller collects it from the customer and pays it to the respective government.","Sales Tax: In the United States, sales tax is imposed on the purchase of goods. However, it's important to note that sales tax is not levied at the federal level; instead, it is the responsibility of individual states and, in some cases, local governments."
5,"When a good is taxed, the burden of the tax falls mainly on consumers if:",supply is inelastic and demand is elastic.,supply is elastic and demand is inelastic.,the tax is levied on consumers.,the tax is levied on producers.,B,"The correct option is
b. supply is elastic and demand is inelastic
.
When a tax is charged, the burden of the tax is shared by the buyers and sellers. If demand is relatively more inelastic than supply, buyers have to bear most of the tax burden. This is the case in option
b
.","Tax Burden: When a tax is charged on a product, it is not the case that the seller pays all of the tax. Some of the tax is passed on to buyers in the form of higher prices. Who pays a higher proportion of the tax depends on the market dynamics."
6,A tax placed on chocolate will:,reduce the equilibrium price of chocolate and increase the equilibrium quantity.,increase the equilibrium price of chocolate and reduce the equilibrium quantity.,increase the equilibrium price of chocolate and increase the equilibrium quantity.,reduce the equilibrium price of chocolate and reduce the equilibrium quantity.,B,"A tax placed on chocolate will:
b. increase the equilibrium price of chocolate and reduce the equilibrium quantity.
A tax placed on chocolate means that the consumers have to pay a higher price on chocolates and the seller receives a lower price per unit of chocolate. If the tax is placed on the seller, a higher tax discourages supply shifting the supply curve towards the left. With unchanged demand, this means that consumer has to pay a higher price, and the equilibrium quantity of chocolate falls. The difference between the amount paid by the consumer and the amount received by the seller is the tax.
Analysis of incorrect options:
a. reduce the equilibrium price of chocolate and increase the equilibrium quantity because a tax always increases the equilibrium price.
c. Increasing the equilibrium price of chocolate and increasing the equilibrium quantity is incorrect because a tax raises equilibrium price. The consumers reduce their quantity demanded at higher prices.
d. Reducing the equilibrium price of chocolate and reducing the equilibrium quantity is incorrect because equilibrium price is not reduced but increased due to taxes.",Tax: A tax is a payment that is made by certain authorities to the government of the nation. Taxes act as a source of revenue for the government. This revenue is used by them to develop the nation and investment in various developmental and societal projects that will benefit the nation.
7,Tax incidence indicates,the actual division of the burden of a tax.,the burden of a tax on producers.,the burden of a tax on consumers.,who is not legally required to send a tax payment to the government.,A,"Option A. the actual division of the burden of a tax is correct
This option is correct because tax incidence is the division of the financial burden of a certain tax among the affected parties. By calculating the value of lost utility or wellbeing, it calculates the true cost of a tax imposed by the government.
Option B is incorrect because tax incidence indicates burden falls on the producers is true statement.
Option C is incorrect because tax incidence indicates the burden of a tax on consumers is true statement.
Option D is incorrect because tax incidence indicates who is not legally required to send a tax payment to the government is true statement.","Tax: Taxes are sums of money that citizens are required to pay in accordance with their income, the value of their property, and other factors. These sums of money are used to fund the government's activities."
8,"When a good is taxed, the burden of the tax falls mainly on consumers if:",the tax is levied on consumers.,the tax is levied on producers.,"supply is elastic, and demand is inelastic.","supply is inelastic, and demand is elastic.",C,"c. supply is elastic, and demand is inelastic
When producers exhibit elastic supply, then that means the produces initiate changing their supplies in case of any price change. When consumers exhibit inelastic demand, then the consumers do not make any significant change in demands on price change. Here, customers show less immediate responses towards price change, then it is expected that the tax burden would be levied on consumers.",Tax incidence Tax incidence covers the essential phase when the government levies any change. Tax incidence shows how the economic agents would distribute the burden of taxes among themselves so that the economy would not get adversely impacted.
9,"If the price of a good is not affected by a sales tax, then:",supply is perfectly elastic.,demand is perfectly elastic.,elasticity of supply is greater than elasticity of demand.,elasticity of demand is greater than elasticity of supply.,B,"The correct option is:
B. Demand is perfectly elastic
Reason:
Greater the elasticity of demand greater is the tax burden borne by the producer. So when the demand of a good is perfectly elastic, the entire tax burden is borne by the producer. Hence the price of the good remains the same.",Incidence of Tax: Tax incidence is the final burden of tax which is either borne by the consumer or by the producer. The tax incidence depends upon the elasticity of demand and supply.
10,Tax incidence analysis seeks to determine:,who actually sends the tax payment to the government.,who actually pays the tax.,who ultimately gets the tax revenue.,whether a tax is in the benefits-received category or the ability-to-pay category.,B,"Tax incidence analysis seeks to determine:
b. who actually pays the tax.
Tax incidence, as the word signifies, measures the burden of taxes that are paid by individuals. It measures the burden and incidence of individuals paying taxes. It measures the distribution of economic burden among affected individuals.
a. Tax incidence measures the amount if tax each affected party pays. It does not matter who send the tax to the government but the payment of taxes matter.
c. The government gets the tax revenue as their income and this is different from tax incidence.
d. Whether a tax is in the benefits-received category or the ability-to-pay category is a different concept relating to taxation. It determines the distribution of taxes.",Taxes: Taxes are the compulsory payments made by individuals or companies to the government. Taxes act as the main source of generating income for the government. This income is then used by the government to spend on various developmental activities in the economy.

11,"If the demand for bread is more elastic than the supply of bread, which group will bear more of the incidence of a tax on bread?",Consumers.,Producers.,The government.,Neither consumers nor producers.,B,"If the demand for bread is more elastic than the supply of bread, which group will bear more of the incidence of a tax on bread?
b. Producers.
Because the supply is less elastic than the demand, consumers will readily shift to a substitute product when the price increases due to the tax.  That means that producers will pay all or most of the tax . Depending on the elasticity of demand, consumers may pay a smaller portion of the tax. The government levies the tax - it does not pay the tax.",Incidence of a Tax: Governments may levy a tax on a good or a service for a variety of reasons. The incidence of the tax means who will pay what share of the tax. How the incidence of the tax is divided depends on the elasticity of demand for the product.

13,"""Which side of the market, supply or demand, that bears the burden of a tax on a good or service depending upon the relative supply and demand:""",elasticities.,surpluses.,shortages.,,A,"The correct option is a. elasticities.
The amount of tax burden that a consumer or producer bears depend on the relative elasticities of the supply and demand. If the elasticity of supply is more than the elasticity of demand, then the consumer bears more share of the tax burden. Similarly, if the elasticity of demand is more than the elasticity of supply, then the producer or seller bears a higher tax burden than the consumer.
Thus, the side of the market, supply or demand, that bears the burden of a tax on a good or service depends upon the relative supply and demand elasticities.
Reasons for incorrect options:
Option b. is incorrect because consumer and producer surpluses do not have any relation to the tax burden.
Option c. is incorrect because shortages show that demand is greater than supply, and it shows no relation with the tax burden.",Tax burden Tax burden is the difference between the price after tax and the price before tax. It is the difference between the price paid by a consumer after and before the tax and the price received by the seller after the tax and before the tax.
14,"If the incidence of the tax is more on the seller and less on the buyer,",The demand for the taxed commodity is highly elastic,The demand for the taxed commodity is perfectly inelastic,The supply of the taxed commodity is highly elastic,The supply of the taxed commodity is perfectly inelastic,A,"The correct answer is
A. The demand for the taxed commodity is highly elastic.
When a good is highly elastic, it means that a price change will highly affect its demand. When a good is highly inelastic, a change in price does not affect the demand for the good. The tax burden is transferred to the seller for elastic goods because consumers will shift to other affordable products. Causing a decline in demand. For inelastic goods, the tax burden is generated to the consumers because the good is a necessity, and there are no close substitutes for the same product. In the case of an inelastic product such as medical expenses, consumers have limited options and stick to the same product or service, despite the price level. When the tax burden concentrates on buyers, the demand is affected, but the supply is affected when it concentrates on suppliers or producers.","Tax Incidence: Tax incidence can be perceived as the division of tax burden between stakeholders who may be producers and consumers or buyers and sellers. In some cases, tax incidence can also be used to determine who incurs the tax burden when a new tax is implemented or when a new tax rule is formed."

a. decrease the effective price of coffee received by sellers and decrease the equilibrium quantity of coffee.
The price elasticity of demand will determine who pays what share of the tax. If the demand is highly inelastic, most of the tax will likely be passed on to the buyers, but the sellers will suffer some decrease in their effective price. The higher price of coffee created by the tax will decrease the equilibrium quantity.
Thus, none of these answers can be correct:
b. increase the effective price of coffee received by sellers, and decrease the equilibrium quantity of coffee.
c. increase the effective price of coffee received by sellers, and increase the equilibrium quantity of coffee.
d. decrease the effective price of coffee received by sellers and increase the equilibrium quantity of coffee.","Incidence of a Tax: When a government levies a tax on a good or a service, the incidence of the tax describes whether the buyer or the seller pays the tax or whether they share in the payment."
16,"As a paid tax preparer, you are automatically authorized to represent your client before the IRS.",True,False,,,B,"b. False.
Even if you get paid to do taxes, that doesn't mean you have the right to represent your client in front of the IRS. Only enrolled agents, CPAs, and attorneys are allowed to represent taxpayers before the IRS. These experts have proven their proficiency by passing difficult examinations or fulfilling other significant requirements.
The IRS's Annual Filing Season Program (AFSP) Record of Completion is a certification available to tax preparers who are not enrolled agents, certified public accountants, or attorneys. This means that non-credentialed tax preparers can represent clients whose returns they prepared and signed, but only in front of specific IRS employees like customer service reps.
Therefore, you cannot represent clients before the IRS just because you are a paid tax preparer.","Internal Revenue Services: To collect taxes from citizens and businesses and to enforce the country's tax code, the government funds the Internal Revenue Service.

17,The following taxes are regressive except:,FICA and self-employment taxes,federal income tax for individuals,All of these.,unemployment taxes,B,"The correct option is
B. federal income tax for individuals
The individual federal income tax is not a regressive tax but rather a progressive tax. Tax rates in a progressive system rise in tandem with a person's or business's taxable income. Therefore, the tax burden is heavier for those with higher incomes compared to those with lower incomes. The system here takes into account each individual's financial situation.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
A. FICA and self-employment taxes
Because FICA and self-employment taxes are generally viewed as regressive, option A is incorrect. They are imposed at a flat rate up to a certain income level, so those with lower incomes pay a larger share of their income in this way than those with higher incomes.
C. All of these.
Since option A and D is not correct, this can not be correct.
D. unemployment taxes
Since unemployment taxes are often levied at a flat rate and have a wage base limit, which means that those with higher incomes pay a smaller percentage of their income in these taxes, option D is incorrect.","Progressive Tax: Progressive tax refers to the tax strategy of the Internal Revenue Service, where the tax rate increases as income rises. Higher-earning individuals pay higher tax, and lower-income people pay lower tax."
18,"Consider the information given below. If a tax were imposed on turkey meat, who would bear the burden of the tax?",The entire tax would be paid by consumers,The majority of the tax would be paid by consumers,The tax would be paid equally by consumers and producers,The majority of the tax would be paid by producers,B,"The correct option is
b. The majority of the tax would be paid by consumers
.
The imposition of the tax would increase the price of the turkey in the market. The price elasticity depicts the change in the demand and supply responses of the consumers and the sellers, respectively, corresponding to a price change. In this case, the absolute price elasticity of demand is 0.20, which is less than 1, implying that demand is price inelastic. Inelastic depicts that a price change would change the demand less than proportionately. On the other hand, the price elasticity of supply is 1.60, which is greater than 1. Hence, supply is price elastic, and small price change affects the quantity supplied more than proportionately. Thus, an imposition of the tax would result in consumers sharing the major burden compared to the producers.
The other options are incorrect.
a. The entire tax would be paid by consumers. The price elasticity is not perfectly inelastic. Hence, the entire burden will not be shared by the consumers.
c. The tax would be paid equally by consumers and producers. Demand is price inelastic, and supply is price elastic. Hence, consumers will bear more burden than the producers.
d. The majority of the tax would be paid by producers. The producers' supply responses are elastic to price change and would not bear more tax burden.","Tax: In economics, the tax refers to the sum collected by the government from the consumers and producers in purchasing or producing goods and services.

19,A tax placed on kite buyers will shift:,"demand upward, causing both the price received by sellers and the equilibrium quantity to fall.","demand downward, causing both the price received by sellers and the equilibrium quantity to fall.","supply downward, causing the price received by sellers to fall and equilibrium quantity to rise.","supply upward, causing the price received by sellers to rise and equilibrium quantity to fall.",B,"A tax placed on kite buyers will shift b. demand downward, causing both the price received by sellers and the equilibrium quantity to fall. Yes, this is the best answer. A tax added on buyers has the effect of raising the price and thus decreasing the quantity demanded. When the quantity demanded decreases, the price decreases as well.
These answers are incorrect.
a. demand upward, causing both the price received by sellers and the equilibrium quantity to fall.
c. supply downward, causing the price received by sellers to fall and equilibrium quantity to rise.
d. supply upward, causing the price received by sellers to rise and equilibrium quantity to fall.",Tax Incidence: The incidence of a tax means how the tax charged is divided between the buyer and the seller. The elasticity of demand is a factor in determining the incidence of a tax.
20,"If labor supply is perfectly inelastic, the economic incidence of the payroll tax:",is the same as the statutory incidence of the tax,"is split equally between workers and consumers, because firms pass on their share in the form of higher prices",falls entirely on firms,falls entirely on workers,D,"The correct option is
option d)
.
If labor supply is perfectly inelastic, the economic incidence of the payroll tax falls entirely on workers.
Given that the labor supply is perfectly inelastic, the labor supply would not vary with the changes in the wage rate. When a payroll tax is imposed, the employers will shift the tax burden to the employees. This shifting will be done by reducing salary equal to the amount of tax imposed. The firms can shift the whole burden of the tax to the workers due to the inelasticity of supply. As is known, the incidence is the ultimate tax burden, so the ultimate burden is on the workers.
Hence, the economic incidence of tax is wholly borne by the workers.
Reasons for incorrect options are
Option a)
The statutory incidence of the tax is on the employers, not the workers.
Option b)
As the payroll taxes are concerned, the consumers paying taxes will not be considered.
Option c)
The incidence would fall on the firms if the labor supply were perfectly elastic.",Payroll Taxes: Payroll taxes are the compulsory payment made by employers to the public authorities from the employees' salaries. These taxes get deducted before the employees receive their salaries. These payments are made to finance social security programs.
21,"According to economists, an efficient tax is one that:",is relatively easy to collect relative to the revenue it generates.,maximizes tax revenue for the government.,splits the tax burden equally between consumers and producers.,imposes a small relative to the tax revenue it raises.,D,"Whether a tax is efficient is judged on various criteria, such as the costs (legal and administrative) associated with the imposition of the tax and the burden of the tax on society. The costs associated with the implementation of a tax system are as follows.
1. The administrative costs of running the tax system.
2. The costs associated with the compliance of the tax system through tax collection.
3. The costs associated with the filing of tax returns.
The implementation of a tax creates a deadweight loss (DWL) in society, which is also an efficiency cost. Taxes cause the price received by sellers to decrease and the price paid by users, buyers, or consumers to increase, thereby reducing the socially-efficient outcome.
So, an efficient tax is defined as the one where the decision taken by a business or individual would minimize their tax liability. So, a tax is efficient when it minimizes the DWL and simultaneously maximizes the revenue generated for the government. DWL is created as the market is forced to include the tax, which distorts the demand-supply working and reduces the social surplus. The burden of tax is shared between producers and consumers. However, the government uses tax revenue for public expenditure, which increases social welfare. Thus, the efficient tax is one that imposes a small DWL (loss of social surplus) relative to the total revenue generated by it. So, the correct choice is
option d
.
Option a)
This is not the correct choice. By the definition of tax efficiency, an efficient tax should minimize DWL and maximize the revenue generated by it. A tax may be easy to collect but it is not efficient unless it addresses the DWL associated with it.
Option b)
This is not the correct choice. An efficient tax not only maximizes the government-collected tax revenue but also minimizes the social loss created by it. This option does not consider the DWL or the loss of economic efficiency of the tax system.
Option c)
This is not the correct choice. Tax efficiency comes from maximizing government tax revenue and minimizing DWL. A tax that equally distributes the tax burden on producers and consumers may be equitable but not necessarily efficient.",Tax System: The tax system is the official administrative way by which a government levies taxes in the economy. Tax is a mandatory payment that the subjects of an economy have to pay to the government without wanting anything in return.

b. $13,000.
Given information:
Capital gains = $10,000
Capital losses = $25,000
Since the capital losses exceed the capital gains in the year, there will be a net capital loss. In this case, the capital gains will be written off 100%. In addition, an amount of $3,000 from the net capital loss is eligible to be deducted from taxable income. The remaining net capital loss will be carried forward to the next year.
Net capital loss = Capital losses - Capital gains = $25,000 - $10,000 = $15,000
Write-off for capital gain = $10,000
Write-off for net capital loss = lesser of $3,000 or remaining capital loss ($15,000) = $3,000

23,Suppose the government removes a tax on buyers of a good and levies a tax of the same size on sellers of the good. How does this change in tax policy affect each of the following?,the price that buyers pay sellers for this good,the amount buyers are out of pocket (including any tax payments they make),the amount sellers receive (net of any tax payments they make),the quantity of the good sold,D,"Suppose the tax levied on buyers was removed and is now levied on sellers in equal amounts by the government. This change in tax policy means that now the sellers have to pay the tax. But the actual burden of tax is independent of the fact on whom tax is imposed. The elasticity of supply and demand determines the tax burden.
a. The price that buyers have to pay to the sellers after tax is the same in both the cases where a buyer pays the tax and where a seller pays the tax. The increase in price after tax depends on the tax burden shared by the producers and consumers.
b. The out-of-pocket expense of buyers, the amount paid in tax is again determined by the actual burden of tax which remains the same irrespective of whether the buyer pays the tax or sellers pay it.
c. The price received by sellers is the after-tax amount they get, which remains the same in both cases where the buyer pays the tax and the seller pays the tax determined by the tax incidence on buyers and sellers.
d. The quantity of the good sold falls in both the cases where the buyers pay the tax and where the sellers pay the tax by the same amount.
Thus, it can be concluded that the final effect of tax on market price, quantity, the price paid by buyers, and the price received by sellers remains the same regardless of who pays the tax.",Burden of Tax: The tax burden refers to the share of tax borne by the consumers and producers of the total tax imposed by the government.

24,"If a policymaker wants to raise revenue by taxing goods while minimizing the deadweight losses, he should look for goods with _____ elasticities of demand and _____ elasticities of supply.","small, small","small, large","large, small","large, large",A,"The correct answer is:
A. small, small.
Reason:
If a policymaker wants to raise revenue by taxing goods while minimizing the deadweight losses, he should look for goods with small elasticities of demand and small elasticities of supply.
The dead weight loss due to taxation reduces when the elasticity of demand and supply reduces. Inelastic demand and supply leads to lesser changes in quantity demanded and supplied due to change in price of good due  to taxation. When  the elasticity of demand and supply of good increases, the dead weight loss due to taxation also increases. Hence if the government wants to reduce the dead weight loss from taxation, it should impose taxes on good which has smaller elasticity of demand and supply.",Elasticity: Elasticity is an economic concept which measures the change in quantity demanded of a good due to change in price of the good. Elasticity of demand and supply determines the incidence of tax on buyers and producers.
25,"In the final analysis, tax incidence:",depends on the forces of supply and demand,is entirely random,falls entirely on buyers or entirely on sellers,depends on the legislated burden,A,"The correct option is
A. depends on the forces of supply and demand
.
A tax incidence helps to determine how the burden of taxes is shared between buyers and sellers. Thus, the shape or elasticities of demand and supply curves helps to determine the burden of taxes on buyers and sellers. Usually, when the demand is more inelastic than supply, buyers will bear the most tax burden whereas when the supply is more inelastic than demand, sellers will bear the most tax burden.","Tax: In microeconomics, a tax is defined as a legal financial charge by the government on its citizen's earned income.

26,The value-added tax is a type of consumption tax.,True,False,,,A,"The correct answer is
option A. True
.
Value-added tax (VAT) can be explained as the type of indirect tax that applies to an increase in value at each stage of the supply chain, which includes the production, distribution, and sale of goods or services. VAT is a type of consumption tax because the ultimate consumer of the goods indirectly pays the taxes; the price of the goods includes the taxes that are borne by the consumer when they buy the goods. It is one of the major sources of revenue for the government, as the tax proceeds that the businesses collect from consumers are ultimately paid to them.","Tax: Tax is a compulsory financial obligation towards the government, and it is levied on businesses, entities, and individuals.

27,Congress and the president decide that the United States should reduce air pollution by reducing its use of gasoline. They impose a $0.50 tax on each gallon of gasoline sold.,Should they impose this tax on producers or consumers? Explain carefully using a supply-and-demand diagram.,"If the demand for gasoline were more elastic, would this tax be more effective or less effective in reducing the quantity of gasoline consumed? Explain with both words and a diagram.",,,A,"a)
Congress wants to reduce air pollution and, in this account, wants to impose a tax of $0.50. It makes no difference who the tax is imposed on. But the incidence of tax will fall most heavily on consumers because in real life, the demand for gas is very inelastic.
With the imposition of the tax, the demand curve falls by the tax amount. The seller will receive $3.7, and the buyers have to pay more than the seller receives, which is $4.2. The quantity falls from 120 units to 80 units. The diagram below illustrates the explanation:
b)
Elastic demand says that quantity changes more than the price change. So, the demand is more elastic than the supply in this case; thus, the sellers will bear the tax burden when the demand is elastic, which also means that consumers have choices. In this case, the policy will be effective as to reduce the quantity of gasoline consumption. The diagram below illustrates the explanation:","Tax: To correct negative externalities the government may uses taxes to correct them. With the imposing of tax, the price increase makes it hard for the consumer to consume at the the same levels as before the tax; thus demand falls."
28,Income taxes can be accurately said to:,affect the decision to work and save.,have no effect on the decision to work and save.,result in more dependence on support from the federal government.,have a positive effect on the decision to work but a negative effect on the decision to save.,A,"The correct option is a. affect the decision to work and save.
Income taxes have a direct impact on a person's net labor income and savings returns, which in turn affects their choice to work more (or less) and save more (or less). If people believe they aren't keeping enough of their earned income, higher income tax rates may deter them from working more hours. Similar to the above, high tax rates on savings returns may deter saving. In essence, income taxes have the power to change the ratio of current consumption to future consumption.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
b. have no effect on the decision to work and save:
Income taxes do have an impact on whether or not people choose to work and save money, so option b is untrue.
c. result in more dependence on support from the federal government:
This choice is incorrect because income taxes do not directly lead to increased reliance on federal assistance. Government services are funded by taxes, but this does not always result in greater dependency.

30,The tax incidence falls heaviest on the side of the market that:,has the most inelastic curve.,has the curve furthest to the right.,has the most elastic curve.,has the curve furthest to the left.,A,"The correct option is a)
The elasticity of demand and supply determines the incidence of tax, and according to that, it is determined whether the buyer or the producers will bear the tax. But if it is to be considered whether the tax incidence will be highest, then the incidence of tax will be on that side of the market with the most inelastic curve.
Reasons for incorrect options
Option b) is incorrect because tax incidence will not be heaviest on the curve that is furthest to the right.
Option c) is incorrect because the most elastic curve will not have the highest tax incidence.
Option d) is incorrect because tax incidence will not be highest on the curve furthest to the left.","Tax Incidence: Tax incidence refers to the liability to pay the tax. This means the person will finally be held liable for the payment of the tax. Taxes can be direct and indirect, and based on these, the incidence of tax is calculated."
31,Total inefficiency caused by a tax is the sum of _____ and _____.,administrative costs; deadweight loss,producer surplus; government revenue,producer deficit; consumer surplus,opportunity costs; consumer deficit,A,"The correct option is
A. administrative costs; deadweight loss
.
Taxes diminish a society's efficiency by incurring high administrative costs, resulting in deadweight losses. Firstly, tax imposes a burden on the government that charges it due to the high expense of collection and administration. Collecting taxes from all income earners is extremely difficult and expensive. After collection, the tax amount had to be maintained and evaluated, and other operations had a large administrative expense. Thus, the tax causes inefficiencies in the economy by raising unproductive government expenses.
Second, taxes lower both manufacturing and consumer surpluses. The extra amount a seller gains when the market price of his goods exceeds the minimal amount he is prepared to accept for that item is referred to as producer surplus. Consumer surplus, on the other hand, represents the extra amount obtained by a buyer when the market price of the acquired item is less than what the buyer is prepared to spend for that item. When the government levies a tax on a certain item, the market price of that item rises. The consumer surplus decreased as the tax reduced the gap between the consumer's anticipated costs and the actual cost of the goods.
Producers, on the other hand, although receiving larger revenues from sales than previously, must pay a considerable sum to the government in the form of tax. As a result, producer surplus falls as the difference between the producer's minimum acceptable price and the actual price shrinks. As a result of the tax, the equilibrium quantity transacted also decreases. However, only the government benefits from increased tax collection. Finally, the amount of surplus loss incurred by both the buyer and the seller not absorbed by the government and reduces the transaction output is referred to as deadweight loss. It demonstrates the inefficiencies of taxes by illustrating how taxation harms consumers and producers.
Thus, Total inefficiency caused by a tax is the sum of
administrative cost
and
deadweight loss
.
The other options are incorrect:
B. producer surplus; government revenue. The inefficiency associated with taxes is attributable to the expense borne by society, which makes all economic actors worse. Producer surplus and government income benefit both producers and the government. As a result, tax inefficiency is unrelated to producer surplus and state revenue.
C. producer deficit; consumer surplus. A consumer surplus is a monetary gain on a purchase made by the customer. Tax cannot benefit consumers since it boosts the price charged to buyers. As a result, consumer surplus cannot demonstrate inefficiency in taxes. However, a producer deficit indicates inefficient taxation.
D. opportunity costs; consumer deficit. Although tax increases the price of a commodity and leads to consumer deficit, opportunity cost does not represent tax inefficiency since it occurs in every economic activity in the form of the forgone gain of conducting an alternative activity without the need for tax imposition.","Tax: Taxes are the annual, necessary contributions made by a nation's citizens to its government.

32,"Consumers will bear more of the burden of tax, the:",more elastic supply is.,more elastic demand is.,the more inelastic supply is.,"Consumers always bear the burden of the tax, since they pay the final price.",A,"The correct option is
option A)
.
When supply is more elastic, it means that a small price change will lead to a greater change in the supply of the product. So, the burden of the tax is shifted to the consumers since demand is less elastic than supply, i.e., the price change will not affect demand as much as it would affect supply.
Option B)
is incorrect because if the demand is more elastic, the burden will be borne by the producers rather than consumers.
Option C)
is incorrect because if supply is inelastic, the whole burden of the tax will be borne by the producers.
Option D)
is incorrect because consumers do not always bear the burden of the tax, even though they pay the final price the burden may be shared between consumers and producers.","Consumers: Consumers are the entity in the market who based on their wants and outlay, i.e., demand and budget influence the manufacturing of a good.

35,The excess profits tax was first imposed:,during World War I.,during the Civil War.,during the War of 1812.,during the Spanish-American War.,A,"The correct option is
a. during World War I.
During World War I, the first tax on excessive profits was levied. It was implemented as a stopgap measure to raise funds for the war effort by taxing companies' inflated wartime profits. The purpose of the tax was to prevent businesses from engaging in price gouging and profiteering during the national emergency by ensuring that they pay their fair share towards the war financing.
b. during the Civil War:
Since the excess profits tax was not in place during the Civil War. The Union government collected income and excise taxes, among others, to fund the war effort during the Civil War.
c. during the War of 1812:
Because the excess profits tax was not in place during the War of 1812. Customs duties and other indirect taxes were the primary sources of revenue for the federal government at that time.

d. all of the above.
Everything that goes into paying workers is included in payroll and related expenses. Wages and salaries are examples of direct compensation for labor. Fringe benefits, such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off, are extra perks that an employee receives in addition to their base salary. Employers in the United States must withhold and remit Social Security and Medicare from their employees' paychecks. Payroll and related costs encompass not only salaries and wages but also fringe benefits and payroll taxes.","Payroll Tax: The payroll can be paid by both the employees and the employers, where some deductions are made from the paychecks of the employees, and employers also pay some portion, and the accumulated amount from the economy is used to fund the employee's welfare schemes."

a. a classical economics concept in nature:
A concept with roots in classical economics, which emphasizes slow and steady growth over short-term stimulus measures. Keynesian economics, which prioritizes short-term stability, is more congruent with tax and spending policies.
c. primarily an emphasis on free enterprise economy:

Who will pay for this tax increase in the short run?,"Consumers, because gasoline demand is elastic.","Suppliers, because consumers do not have suitable substitutes for gasoline.","Consumers, because gasoline demand is inelastic.","Suppliers, because it is easy to obtain gasoline supplies from other states.",C,"The correct option is
C. Consumers, because gasoline demand is inelastic
.
In the short run, demand for a product such as gasoline is highly inelastic. Suppliers know this. Due to this, when suppliers are charged a tax, they pass on a large proportion of the tax to the consumer as the amount consumed of gasoline will not fall much even if the price rises because of the tax.","Tax Incidence: When a tax is charged on a product, the supplier does not pay all of the tax.

{/eq}
The cash collected from the customer is $4,000 and 4% sales tax of $320 ($4,000 × 4%).  This makes cash flow from the operating activities amount to $4,320.  The revenue is the sales price of $4,000, which also increases the equity.  The sales tax collected from the customer is recognized as a liability.  Note that the sales tax collected from the customer is not a company expense and does not decrease the $4,000 revenue.  Thus, (a) is the correct answer.","Sales Taxes Sales taxes are taxes imposed on goods and or services of a seller.  These taxes are allowed by law to be passed on to the customer, who, in turn, pays the sales taxes.

40,"The more elastic a product is, the less tax revenue will be raised if we tax the product.",True,False,,,A,"The following statement is
a. True
.
The total tax revenue that government will raise depends on the elasticity of the responses of the suppliers and the consumers. The elasticity refers to the degree of alteration in the total quantity produced or consumed due to changes in the price of goods and services. The demand or supply is elastic to price change when the total quantity produced or consumed alters more than proportionately, corresponding to a small change in the price. In this case, if the government imposes a tax on the suppliers or consumers with elastic responses, they will easily choose to produce or consume other goods and services, decreasing the production or consumption of the goods that have been taxed. As a result, the revenue collected by the government decreases.","Tax Revenue: In economics, tax revenue refers to the total sum of money the government collects from the producers and consumers on selling or purchasing certain items.

Option (B)
.
Perfectly Inelastic supply indicates that the supplier would not respond to the change in demand for the commodity by the consumers. In such a case, the supply curve is a vertical line and supplies a fixed quantity Q. Before the imposition of the tax, the producer would receive the surplus as denoted in figure 1, and the consumer would receive the consumer surplus as denoted. Further, on the imposition of a tax, the consumers would not be affected, and their surplus will remain unchanged. At the same time, the whole burden of the tax would fall on the producer, followed by a decrease in their surplus.
Option (A)
is incorrect because an inelastic demand curve would lead the consumers to bear the tax burden, not the suppliers.
Option (C)
is incorrect because the elastic supply curve also determines that the consumers and not the sellers bear the burden.
Option (D)
is incorrect because the elasticity of one suggests that both supply and demand will change equally with the price change; in this case, both producer and consumer bear the tax equally.",Taxation and Suppliers: Taxation signifies the act of the government to extract surplus from both consumers and suppliers for its own expenditure. The burden of tax depends on the elasticity of supply and demand curves. A perfectly elastic demand curve and inelastic supply curve cause the supplier to bear the entire tax.

44,"When a tax is placed on the buyers of a product, the:","effective price received by sellers decreases, and the price paid by buyers increases",demand for the product decreases,size of the market decreases,All of the above are correct.,D,"The answer is D. All of the above are correct.
Reasons, why A, B, and C are correct:
A. effective price received by sellers decreases, and the price paid by buyers increases.
When a tax is levied on a buyer, the tax incidence or difference may still be determined, even though buyers and sellers share the overall burden of the tax. Buyers pay more, and sellers receive a lower price for their goods. The difference, on the other hand, goes to the government as income.
B. demand for the product decreases
When demand is elastic, the buyer is price sensitive, which means that a price increase leads to a big decline in the quantity desired. Furthermore, the levy of the tax raises the market price (amount to the provider plus amount to the government), resulting in a fall in the quantity demanded. The demand curve shifts downwards indicating that tax reduces the quantity demanded of the goods by the buyers.
C. size of the market decreases
Since imposing a tax on the buyer causes the equilibrium price of the product as well as the equilibrium quantity to decline, it results in a reduction in the size of the product's market. Buyers will also receive fewer items at a higher price as a result of the tax.
.","Tax Incidence: This is a phrase used to refer to the way the tax liability is distributed among the parties who interact in a market for a certain product. The price elasticity of supply and demand has an impact on the tax incidence, and the majority of the burden shifts to the less elastic side since the less elastic side cannot react quickly to tax by adjusting the quantity."

46,"As long as neither supply nor demand is perfectly elastic, both suppliers and demanders will pay part of any tax.",True,False,,,A,"True.
Tax incidence depends on the relationship between demand and supply elasticity.  In the event neither demand nor supply is perfectly elastic, then the respective tax burden is divided between consumers (demand) and producers (supply). If the supply curve is perfectly elastic, then the entire tax is paid by the consumers. If the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the producers will pay the entire tax.","Tax Incidence The government introduces a tax towards the production of a product or the consumption of a product. When the tax is imposed, the way in which it is shared or divided between the seller and the buyer is known asTax Incidence."
47,The tax benefit received from a tax credit is never affected by the tax rate of the taxpayer.,True,False,,,A,"The statement is
true
.
The tax benefit received from a tax credit is never affected by the tax rate of the taxpayer because a tax credit is deducted from the tax on the taxable amount, which is used for calculating the net tax payable.

We can see from the calculation above that tax credits are deducted after the tax rates have been applied to calculate the tax on the taxable income. This means that a $1,000 tax credit will bring the same amount of tax relief for a taxpayer with a tax rate of 15% and a taxpayer with a tax rate of 40%.

a. An excise tax on blueberries or a sales tax on all goods and services.
Blueberries are consumed by a fraction of people while a tax on all good and services will cause a greater tax burden on majority of population that consume them.
b. A tax on income or a tax on all goods and services
A tax on income will create a greater burden because a part of income is saved. Hence, a tax on all goods and services will not affect the level of saving but a tax on income will reduce it.
c. A tax on your age or a tax on income.
A tax on your age will reduce it and will reduce the income for many years so this poses a greater burden.
d. A tax on your weight or a tax on your age

The correct answer is -
Option (D) Sales and Property Taxes
Explanation -
The major sources of revenue for the state or local government includes intergovernmental transfers, property tax, sales tax, charges & miscellaneous. Income tax is collected by the federal government and hence option (A) and option (C) are incorrect. Similarly, the luxury tax goes to the federal government. In the United States, it was enacted in 1991 to reduce federal budget deficits.","Tax Revenue: The government sectors primary source of revenue collection are taxes.

The purpose of this tax is to fund the federal state unemployment insurance program, which benefits unemployed workers who are eligible. Employers pay this tax based on their payroll, and employees do not pay it.
The other answer options are incorrect.
a. Federal income tax: This is not the correct option because employees do pay the federal income tax based on their earnings and the federal government's tax structure.
b. FICA tax: This option is not correct because deductions from the employee's salary are made under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act to fund the Social Security and Medicare programs.
d. State income tax: State income tax can also be deducted from the employee's salary, depending on the tax structure.","Tax Structure: The overall framework that calculates, collects, and administers taxes within a country is known as the tax system.
