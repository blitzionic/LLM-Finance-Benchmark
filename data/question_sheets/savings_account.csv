1,"How much will you have in a savings account in ten years, if you deposit $1,100 in the account at the end of each year and the account earns 10% interest, compounded annually?","$12,100","$22,258","$17,531","$11,000",C,"The correct answer is c. $17,531.
Given information:
Amount invested (P) = $1,100
Rate (r) = 10% = 0.01
Number of years (n) = 10
Computation amount after 10 years:
{eq}\begin{align*}

2,"When you place your funds in a savings account at a bank, those funds are",an asset to you and a liability to the bank.,a liability to you and an asset to the bank.,an asset both to you and the bank.,a liability both to you and the bank.,A,"The answer is
A) an asset to you and a liability to the bank.
Instead of holding cash in hand, an investor can leave cash in a bank's savings account. The fund in a savings account is accessible easily. With that being said, money in a savings account is still the account owner's asset.
In the other hand, the bank pays interests on a savings account, and lends received money to other individuals or organizations. Hence, a bank will recognize the fund from people's savings accounts as its liabilities.",Savings Account: A savings account will be offered with a provision that the account owner will earn interest on the account balance. Most savings accounts allow the owner to cash out their money as a checking account.
3,"Bank overdrafts, if material, should be:",reported as a deduction from the current asset section.,reported as a deduction from cash.,netted against cash and a net cash amount reported.,reported as a current liability.,D,"Answer:
d. reported as a current liability.

4,An individual checking or savings account can be set up to go automatically to another person when the depositor dies if it is set up as a(n):,payable at death.,estate account.,obituarial account.,joint tenancy account.,A,"_Option a is the correct answer
_
A savings account can be set up to go automatically to another person when the depositor dies if it is set up as a payable at death. The bank releases the accounts money to other person if the savings account is set on payable at death.
Explanation for incorrect option:
Option b: It is an incorrect option because an estate account is a new account that is opened after the death of the depositor and the executor deposits the money of the depositor or deceased's account for paying the liabilities of the deceased from it.
Option c: It is an incorrect option because obituarial accounts are maintained for the demise of the machine.
Option d: It is an incorrect option because a joint tenancy account is an account that can allow more than one to access the account.","Savings account: Savings account is the type of account that can be opened with a minimum initial deposit that varies from bank to bank.

5,Another name for a regular savings account is a:,Certificate of deposit,Checking account,Money market account,Passbook or statement account,D,"Correct answer:
Option D) Passbook or statement account.
Explanation:

6,"In the combined Solow-Romer model, the steady-state level of output is positively related to the saving and depreciation rates.",True,False,,,B,"The given statement is
FALSE
.
This is because the Solow-Romer model provides the equilibrium level of economic output. An increase in savings leads to an increase in investment in the economy. As a result, manufacturing activities and economic output will increase. However, depreciation of capital leads to reduce the worth of capital and other assets. As a result, economic activities and economic output would reduce.","Savings: Savings is that part of income that is kept aside for the future consumption purpose. The saved amount is not invested anywhere, and it can be used at any time as per the requirement of an individual."
7,"You have $2,158 today in your savings account. How long must you wait for your savings to be worth $4,000 if you are earning 2.1 percent interest, compounded annually?",26.68 years,29.69 years,32.13 years,33.33 years,B,"The correct answer is option b.29.69 years
From the question:
Amount in the savings account is $2,158
Future savings to be worth $4,000
Interest rate is 2.1%
Calculation of duration to receive savings worth $4,000 using the compound interest formula:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm{Amount}} &= {\rm{Principal}} \times {\left( {1 + {\rm{Rate}}} \right)^{{\rm{time}}}}\\\$ 4,000 &= \$ 2,158 \times {\left( {1 + 0.021} \right)^{{\rm{time}}}}\\\frac{{\$ 4,000}}{{\$ 2,158}} &= {\left( {1 + 0.021} \right)^{{\rm{time}}}}\\1.853 &= {\left( {1.021} \right)^{{\rm{time}}}}\end{align*}

{/eq}
Applying log on both sides as follows:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm{In}}\left( {1.853} \right) &= \,{\rm{time}} * \,{\rm{In}}\left( {1.021} \right)\\{\rm{time}} &= \frac{{{\rm{In}}\,\left( {1.853} \right)}}{{{\rm{In}}\left( {1.021} \right)}}\\ &= \frac{{0.6168}}{{0.02078}}\\ &= 29.6823\,{\rm{years}}\end{align*}

{/eq}
Hence, it will take 29.69 years for the savings to be worth $4,000.","Savings Account: A safer option that can increase the value of money at a modest rate is storing it in a savings account. There are limitations regarding withdrawals, but it is one of the most preferred options for accumulating money for short-term needs."
8,An increase in the personal income tax on interest income will:,Decrease desired saving because the expected after-tax real interest rate falls,Increase desired saving because the expected after-tax real interest rate rises,Decrease desired saving because the expected after-tax real interest rate rises,Be uncertain,D,"The correct option is option D: Will be uncertain.
When there is an increase in the personal income tax rate on interest income, the after-tax yield from saving decreases. This can be viewed in an indifference curve framework with consumption this period on the horizontal axis and consumption next period on the vertical axis. There will be an initial equilibrium determined by the tangency between the indifference curve and the budget constraint, with a certain level of consumption in each period. The difference between the intersection of the budget constraint on the horizontal axis and the level of first-period consumption is the level of saving in the first period. When the income tax on interest is introduced, the budget constraint will rotate downward along the vertical axis. Now, with a given level of first-period income, the individual will have a lower maximum consumption in the second period because of the decline in the after-tax rate of interest.
There will be both a substitution and an income effect on first-period consumption and therefore on saving. The substitution effect will be unambiguously positive in its effect on first-period consumption. Since the relative price of current consumption has declined, consumption will increase and saving will decrease. However, the income effect is ambiguous. With the fall in after-tax interest, the individual is now poorer and the effect of that alone depends on whether first-period consumption is a a normal or an inferior good. If it is a normal good, the individual will consume less and save more for the future. The income effect will work against the substitution effect in that case, with an uncertain net result. If consumption is an inferior good, more will be consumed in the first period and that will accentuate the substitution effect leading to more first-period consumption. On balance the ultimate effect is uncertain.",Tax Rate Effects on Desired Saving: The taxation of interest affects the net return from saving. Principles of microeconomics relating to consumer indifference curve analysis can be applied to assess the likely effect of such a tax on the amount of saving.

39,"A closed economy has an income of $1,000, government spending of $200, taxes of $150, and an investment of $250. What is the private saving?",$100,$200,$300,$400,C,"The correct answer is
c) $300
It is given in the question that the economy is a closed economy. Therefore, saving (S) would be equal to investment (I) in the economy. Now savings (S) are calculated by deducting consumption (C ) and government spending (G) from the income. Now, investment is also given as $250. Therefore,
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm{S}} &= {\rm{I}}\\

{\rm{Y}} - {\rm{C}} - {\rm{G}} &= 250

\end{align*}

{/eq}
Now,
The savings (Y - C - G) can be divided into two parts - Private Saving (Y - C - T) and Public Saving (T - G).
Now, the value of Public Savings can be calculated as we are given the value of taxes (T) as well as government spending (G). The value of public saving will be (- 50).
Therefore,
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm{Private}}\;{\rm{Saving}} + \left( { - 50} \right) &= 250\\

{\rm{Private}}\;{\rm{Saving}}& = 300

\end{align*}

{/eq}
Therefore,
the value of private saving is $300
