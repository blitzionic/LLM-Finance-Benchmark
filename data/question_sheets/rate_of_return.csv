18,"If an investment is producing a return that is equal to the required return, the investment's net present value will be:",positive.,greater than the project's initial investment.,zero.,equal to the project's net profit.,C,"If an investment produces a return equal to the required return, the investment's net present value will be
zero.
Explanation:
The net present value of a project is zero when the project does not yield any gain or loss and gives a neutral return. Therefore, the rate of return and the actual return is the same, and there is no profit or loss, i.e. the net present value is 0. The profits expected in the future are zero, and the project could be more attractive.
Reasons for incorrect options:
Reasons for incorrect options:
a.
Positive
a positive net present value will mean that the earnings generated are more than the anticipated costs, and the investment is, therefore, profitable.
b.
Greater than the project's initial investment
when the net present value is positive, the return is more than the initial investment.
d.
Equal to project net profit
if the net present value is positive, the project is profitable and returns higher.
e.
less than or equal to zero
if the net present value is less than or equal to 0, the project will generate a loss for the company, and therefore it is advised not to pursue the project.",Required Rate of Return: A project accelerates a minimum amount of return on its investment. The amount received in the form of return is the required rate of return. It calculates how profitable the project is.

Let us now discuss each alternative:
a. Variable costs are increased
No, if variable costs increase, the operating income will decrease, and if the numerator in the formula decreases, the result is lower.
b. An increase in fixed costs
No, because again the operating income will decrease when costs increase, so the ROI will be lower.
c. Average operating assets are increased
No, because when the denominator in the formula increases, the result decreases
d. Variable costs are decreased

&= \dfrac{\text{Sum of annual returns}}{\text{Total number of years}} \\[0.3 cm]

&= \dfrac{(13\% + 21\% - 12\% + 7\% - 6\%)}{5} \\[0.3cm]

&= \dfrac{23\%}{5} \\[0.3 cm]

&= 4.6\%

\end{align*}

{/eq}
The geometric mean is given by:
{eq}\begin{align*}

&= \text{Product of the factors consisting of given annual returns}^\dfrac{1}{\text{Number of years}} \\[0.3 cm]

&= {((1 + 13\%) * (1 + 21\%) * (1 - 12\%) * (1 + 7\%) * (1 - 6\%))}^\dfrac{1}{5} - 1 \\[0.3 cm]

& = {(1.13 * 1.21 * 0.88 * 1.07 * 0.94)}^\dfrac{1}{5} - 1 \\[0.3 cm]

& = {1.2102}^\dfrac{1}{5} - 1 \\[0.3 cm]

&= 3.89\% \\[0.3 cm]

{/eq}",Returns on Investment: The average returns on an investment are usually measured in terms of geometric mean and arithmetic mean. The geometric mean gives an idea of the compounded annual growth rate whereas the arithmetic return denotes the historical average annual return.
33,"To find the portfolio's average return, we have to multiply each stock's average returns by?",the stocks' standard deviations.,the dollar amount invested in the stock divided by the total dollars invested.,one divided by the total number of stocks.,just the dollars invested in each stock.,B,"The correct option is b
When the average return of a stock is multiplied by the amount invested in each stock and divided by the total amount invested in the portfolio, the result arrived is the average return of a portfolio. It is also known as the weighted average return of a portfolio.
The explanation for incorrect options:
a.
Standard deviation of a portfolio is calculated when the standard deviation is multiplied with weights and correlation between two stocks.
c.
Dividing the average return by the number of stocks does not result in the average return of a portfolio.
d.
Multiplying the average return by dollars invested does not become an average return.","Portfolio: A portfolio consists of a group of financial securities. While choosing the portfolio of securities for his clients a financial planner considers factors such as income level of client, age group, financial objectives, risk capacity, other saving funds available, etc."

35,"In financial capital markets, those who demand financial capital by receiving funds expect to receive a rate of return.",TRUE,FALSE,,,B,"Answer: b. False
In financial capital markets, those who demand financial capital by receiving funds do not expect to receive a rate of return. Instead, it is the supplier of capital that expects some sort of incentive that comes in the form of a rate of return in exchange for lending money. The supplier of capital is called an investor or a creditor, while the one who demands the capital is called a borrower. In business, creditors and borrowers are often entities rather than individuals.","Raising Capital Some of the reasons why companies raise are expanding the business, hiring more employees, or the purchase of new assets. They often issue stocks or bonds or borrow from creditors to finance this."
36,A return of 12% compounded annually is the same as a return of 1% per month.,TRUE,FALSE,,,B,"The formula for effective annual rate is:

37,"An investment that cost $48,000 provided annual cash inflows of $9,000 per year for six years. The desired rate of return is 10%. The actual return from the investment was:",equal to the desired rate of return.,less than the desired rate of return.,the answer cannot be determined from the information provided.,greater than the desired rate of return.,D,"Answer: D. greater than the desired rate of return.
Explanation:
We know that,
{eq}\text{Rate of Return} = \dfrac{\text{Annual Income}}{\text{Initial Investment}} * 100

{/eq}
Given that -
Initial Investment = $48,000
Annual cash inflows = $9,000
{eq}\text{Rate of Return} = \dfrac{\$9,000}{\$48,000} * 100

{/eq}
{eq}\text{Rate of Return} = 0.1875 * 100

{/eq}
{eq}\text{Rate of Return} = 18.75\%

{/eq}
The rate of return (at 18.75%) is greater than the desired rate of return (at 10%).",Rate Of Return: Investors use the rate of return to compare different investment alternatives. The rate of return shows the annual income as a percentage of initial investment and can be used to determine the economic viability of an investment.
38,"In January 2015, the average price of an asset was $27,558. 9 years earlier, the average price was $21,608. What was the annual increase in selling price?",2.74%,3.01%,3.29%,2.47%,D,"The answer is d. 2.47%.  Support is below.
The geometric average return is computed as follows:
Average = (Ending Value / Beginning Value) ^ (1/n) - 1
Average = ($27,558 / $21,608) ^ (1/9) - 1 = .0274","Geometric Average Return: The geometric average return is often referred to as the compound annual growth rate.  It is the annual rate of growth that takes a value from a beginning amount to an ending amount over a specified period of time, given a compound rate of change that occurs evenly over the time period."
