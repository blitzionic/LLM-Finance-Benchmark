1,3/15 net 45 means the seller gets a 3% discount if they pay in 15 days otherwise they must pay within 60 days of the invoice.,TRUE,FALSE,,,B,"The statement is false.
The traders follow a very common tactic of providing trade credits to their customers, which helps them to maintain capital for their day-to-day productions and also helps in the expansion of their business. 3/15 net 45 is also trade credit given to the debtors. It helps the traders to get returns before the decided time from the debtors. The trade-credit given in this question has three elements which are:
1. 3 shows the discount the debtor will get if they pay the trader before the time.
2. 15 shows that the debtors are eligible for the discount only when they pay back within 15 days.
3. net 45 means that if the debtor decides not to accept this offer, they are liable to pay the amount for goods taken on credit within 45 days.
Now, this statement is wrong as the discount rate and the duration of 15 days to get the discount is right, but they are liable to pay the trader within 45 days and not 60 days which makes this statement false.",Trade Credit: When a trader passes the ownership of a product to the customer without getting instant cash but with a promise that the customer will pay back within a decided time is known as trade credit.

Therefore, at maturity, the note payable, interest payable, and interest expense are all debited while cash is credited. So,
the correct answer is option C. A debit to interest expense for $133.","Notes Payable: A note payable is considered a liability for the borrower, representing money that must be repaid to the lender. In accounting, notes payable are recorded on the borrower's balance sheet as a liability, while the lender records it as a receivable in their financial statements."
3,"A business issued a $5,000, 60-day, 12% note to the bank. The amount due at maturity is:","$4,900 ","$5,000 ","$5,100 ","$5,600 ",C,"The amount due at maturity is
c) $5,100
.
The business should start by determining the total interest on the note for 60 days using the following equation:
{eq}\text{Interest on the note} = \dfrac{\text{Face value of the note × Interest rate }}{\text{Total period}} × \text{ Interest period}= \dfrac{\$5,000 × 12\%}{360\,days} × 60\,days = \$100 {/eq}
With the interest on the note, the maturity value of the note can be computed as follows:
Note's maturity value = Face value of the note + Total interest
Note's maturity value = $5,000 + $100
Note's maturity value = $5,100
Note:
A year is assumed to have 360 days.",Notes Payable: Notes payable refer to a financial instrument representing a promise by one party (the borrower) to repay the sum borrowed from the other party (the lender) at a future date. Notes payable are used in business transactions as a source of finance.
4,"A business issued a $5,000, 60-day, 12% note to the bank. The amount due at maturity is:","$5,000.00 ","$4,900.00 ","$5,100.00 ","$5,600.00 ",C,"The correct answer is
c) $5,100
.
The interest accrued for 60 days should be calculated before proceeding with the maturity value computations. Assuming a year to have 360 days, we have accrued interest computation below:
{eq}\text{Interest on the note} = \dfrac{\text{Face value of the note × Interest rate }}{\text{Total period}} × \text{ Interest period}= \dfrac{\$5,000 × 12\%}{360} × 60 = \$100 {/eq}
With the above computation, the maturity value of the note can be computed as follows:
Note's maturity value = Face value of the note + Accrued interest
Note's maturity value = $5,000 + $100
Note's maturity value = $5,100",Accrued Interest: Accrued interest refers to the amount incurred from using the borrowed capital for a specific period but unpaid. It should be recognized as a liability until paid along with the principal repayment.
5,"A sales invoice included the following information: merchandise price, $5,000; terms 1/10, n/eom. Assuming that a credit for merchandise returned of $600 is granted prior to payment, and that the invoice is paid within the discount period, what is the amount of cash received by the seller?","$4,656 ","$4,400 ","$4,356 ","$4,950 ",C,"The correct answer is
option c. $4,356.
Given information:
Sales invoice = $5,000
Sales return = $600
Discount rate = 1%
The credit condition 1/10 indicates that if payment is made within 10 days of the date on the invoice, the company will receive a 1% discount on the total amount payable (excluding the freight amount). The term n/EOM indicates that if the business does not pay within ten days, the full amount will be owed at the end of the month.
Step 1: Determine the net sales, as given below:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Net sales } &=\text{ Sales invoice }-\text{ Sales return} \\ &=\$5,000-\$600 \\ &=\$4,400 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Step 2: Determine the cash received by the seller, as given below:
The discount will also be subtracted from the net sales because the payment was received during the discount period:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Cash received by seller} &=\text{ Net sales }-\left( \text{Net sales}\times \text{Discount rate} \right) \\ &=\$4,400\text{ }-\text{ }\left( \$4,400\text{ }\times \text{ }1\% \right) \\ &=4,400\text{ }-\$44 \\ &=\$4,356 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Thus, the cash received by the sellers will be $4,356.","Credit Term: In accounting, credit terms are the terms of the contract between a buyer and a seller that specify the frequency and sum of the buyer's future payments.

6,"Alco Inc. has assets of $100,000 and multiple bonds payable. Which of the following has the senior claim to Alco Inc.s assets in the event of bankruptcy?",Preferred stockholders.,Common stockholders.,Bondholders.,Owners.,C,"The correct answer is option c. Bondholders.
As a general, the highest priority of claims in times of bankruptcy is the external creditors, then the internal one. In the event of bankruptcy, bondholders have the senior claim to a company's assets compared to stockholders (preferred and common) and owners. This is because bonds are considered debts owed by the company, and debt holders have a higher priority in the repayment hierarchy during bankruptcy proceedings. After bondholders are paid, any remaining assets can be distributed to preferred stockholders, followed by common stockholders and, finally, owners (if any assets remain).
Accordingly, when we arranged the order of priority for the claim, the following is the order.
c. Bondholders.
a. Preferred stockholders.
b. Common stockholders.
d. Owners.
Therefore,
the correct answer is option c. Bondholders.","Bankruptcy: In business and finance, bankruptcy refers to legal steps through which individuals or businesses that are unable to repay their outstanding debts can seek financial relief and protection from their creditors."
7,"Coronado Industries borrowed $410,000 on April 1. The note requires interest at 12% and principal to be paid in one year. How much interest is recognized for the period from April 1 to December 31?",$0 ,"$32,800 ","$36,900 ","$49,200 ",C,"The correct answer is
c. $36,900
.
Coronado Industries should use the following inputs to determine the interest on the note to be recognized as on December 31:
Face value of the promissory note = $410,000
Interest rate = 12%
Accrual period = 9 months (April 1 - December 31).
Upon arranging these inputs logically, we have the following number:
Interest on the note = Face value of the note × Interest rate × {eq}\dfrac{9}{12} {/eq}
Interest on the note = $410,000 × 12% × {eq}\dfrac{9}{12} {/eq}

8,"If a supplier is offering trade credit of 1/10 net 30, and a buyer chooses not to take the discount, when should they pay, assuming that they wish to stay on good terms with the supplier?",any time before day 10,on day 10,any time after day 30,on day 30,D,"The correct answer is option D), i.e., on day 30.
The trade-credit that the supplier is offering simplifies into that the customer will get a discount of 1% on payments for the goods purchased on credit if paid on or before the 10th day of the purchase; otherwise, the customer is liable to pay the full payment for the goods purchased on credit on or before 30 days. Now, it is given that the buyer chose to forgo the discount, which means that the buyer will not pay within or on the 10th day of the purchase, and therefore, now the buyer has 20 days left (30 days-10 days) to make the full payment to stay on good terms with the supplier. So, this deducts options A and B because the buyer has decided to forgo the discount as given in the question.
Option C is that the buyer will pay any time after day 30, which will defer the buyer's payment as the payment will be made after the period decided for trade credit and can form bad terms between the buyer and the supplier.
Option D, which is on day 30, if the buyer pays the amount, it will mean the trade credit terms have been followed, and the buyer has paid the supplier within time, and hence, it will form good terms between both parties.","Trade Credit: Trade credit is when the buyer and seller exchange goods where the seller shifts the ownership of the goods to the buyer, and the buyer promise to pay the amount for the goods on a future date."

d. $61,200
.
The maturity value of the note includes the principal amount and the accrued interest.
The accrual of interest on the note is calculated using the following inputs:
Face value of the note = $60,000
Interest period = 120 days
Days in a year (Assumed) = 360
Interest rate = 6%
Upon the logical arrangement of these inputs, we have the following output:
Interest on the note = Face value of the note × Interest rate × {eq}\dfrac{120}{360} {/eq}
Interest on the note = $60,000 × 6% × {eq}\dfrac{120}{360} {/eq}
Interest on the note = $1,200
Based on this computation, we can determine the note's maturity value:
Note's maturity value = Face value of the note + Interest on the note
Note's maturity value = $60,000 + $1,200
Note's maturity value = $61,200","Interest: When a company borrows through loans or negotiable instruments, it should pay the cost of borrowing along with the principal repayment.

25,Who typically receives first priority when resources are divided as part of a business's liquidation?,Stockholders,Owners,Creditors,Managers,C,"The correct answer is option C: Creditors.
When a business is liquidated, the resources obtained from selling off its assets are distributed among the various entities that the business owes money to, and creditors are most always given first priority. According to the absolute priority rule in bankruptcy law, distribution of resources goes in the following order:
Secured and unsecured creditors
Stockholders
That is, only
after
satisfying all the debts and obligations to creditors are any remaining assets divided among stockholders or owners.
Below are the reasons why the other answer choices are incorrect.
Choice A:
Stockholders are individuals or companies that hold shares in the company. As mentioned above, the absolute priority rule lists them as second after creditors in order of asset distribution when a business is liquidated. Therefore, they receive second priority as opposed to first priority.
Choice B:
Most owners of a company are stockholders of the company. Hence, once again referring to the absolute priority rule, they receive second priority as opposed to first priority during liquidation.
Choice D:
Managers within a company are employees of that company. Hence, during a business liquidation, they don't generally receive any of the resulting resources. The only exception to this is if a manager holds stock in the company in which they are employed making them a shareholder, but managers in general do not receive any priority when dividing resources upon a businesses liquidation.","Business liquidation: Business liquidation is similar to individual bankruptcy, but it is specific to businesses. That is, when a business comes to a point where they can no longer meet their financial obligations, they may choose to liquidate. When this happens, the business liquidates its assets in order to pay those financial obligations that they otherwise could not. Closing of the business usually follows shortly after a liquidation."
