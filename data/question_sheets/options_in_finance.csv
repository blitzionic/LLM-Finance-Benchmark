id,question,A,B,C,D,Answer,Explanation,Hint
1,Selling options on stock you already own:,is illegal under federal law.,cannot benefit you financially.,is called a covered call strategy.,is not a very good idea.,C,"Correct Answer: c
A call option writer can write the option in two conditions: firstly, when the writer owns the stock and secondly, when the writer does not own the stock. Here, the first strategy depicts the covered strategy. Such a strategy is appreciable for the options because it reduces the risk associated with the transaction. A holder can take a short position for the stock they already own in this strategy.
An explanation for incorrect options:
Option a: Writing such types of options is not illegal.
Option b: The financial benefit of these options depend on specific terms of contracts.
Option d: It depends on the contract terms and price situation.","Regulator: In the options market, a body that oversees the legal validity of different projects and frames rules for their identification. It is called the regulator. New financial innovations have increased the complexity of the regulators' role."
2,A straddle is a combination of a put and call on _____.,"the same stock, with the same strike price and expiration date.","different stocks, with the same strike price and expiration date.","different stocks, with different strike price and expiration dates.","the same stock, with the same strike price and different expiration dates.",A,"A straddle is a combination of a put and call on
a. the same stock, with the same strike price and expiration date.
Purchasing a call and a put option on the same stock with the same strike price and expiration allows the investor to benefit from both an increase in the stock price (by exercising the call) and a decrease in the stock price (by exercising the put).  This strategy is called a straddle.  The higher the price change, the higher its payoff.  The cost of the strategy is equal to the premium paid for the two options.
b., c. and d. are incorrect.  Purchasing options on different stocks or the same stock with different expiration dates is not known as any type of option strategy.",Options Strategies: Combinations that involve buying and selling options are called options strategies.  The goal of these strategies is to create a specific payoff profile that is desirable to the investor.
3,"A put option has an exercise price of {eq}\$40

{/eq} and the call premium is {eq}\$5

{/eq}. The current market price of the underlying stock is {eq}\$38

{/eq}.",Is the option in the money or out of the money?,What is the intrinsic value of the option? The time value?,What is the break-even stock price on the option's expiration date?,"If you purchase this option, what is your maximum possible gain?",A,"Part A.
The option is currently in-the-money, because its exercise price is higher than the underlying stock price ($40 vs. $38).
Part B.
The intrinsic value of the option is $2, the difference between its exercise price and the underlying stock price ($40 - $38 = $2).
The time value of the option is $3, the difference between its premium and the intrinsic value ($5 - $2 = $3).
Part C.
The break-even stock price is $35.  At this point, the potential payoff of $5 ($40 - $35 = $5) just equals the cost of the option of $5.
Part D.
The maximum possible gain is as follows:
Max Gain = Strike Price - $0 - $Put Premium
Max Gain = $40 - $0 - $5 = $35","Put Premium: A put premium is the cost of buying a put option, which is the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset at a specified strike price for a period of time.  The buyer must pay the premium to the seller of the option."
4,Which of the following is a characteristic of put and call options?,They are contracts to buy or sell 100 shares of common stock.,There is always a specified price.,There is always a specified time period to exercise options.,All of the above,D,"The correct answer is d. All of the above
A call option is a contract that allows the investor to buy a specific asset at a predetermined price at some point in the future.  A put option is similar, except that it allows the sale of a particular asset in the future.  Call and put options can be written on both real assets (like crude oil) and financial assets (like stocks).
a. is correct.  When the underlying asset is the stock of a company, a call or a put option gives the investor the right to buy or sell 100 shares of that stock.
b. is correct.  The option price is also called the exercise price because this is the price, at which the option can be exercised.  The exercise price is always included in the option contract.
c. is correct.  The option contract also specifies the time period, in which the option can be exercised.  The vast majority of stock options are American-style options.  That means that they can be exercised on the expiration date as well as at any time prior to the expiration date.","Options vs Futures: Options and futures are both legally enforceable contracts.  Unlike futures contracts, in which both parties are bound by their contractual obligations, options contracts are mandatory only for the issuer.  The buyer has the option to back out of the contract."
5,"Although the payouts on a long position in an options contract are never negative, the profit from purchasing and holding it could be negative.",True,False,,,A,"The answer is a. True.  The payoff on a long option contract is associated with the difference between the underlying asset price and the strike price.  If the underlying asset price does not move into a position that warrants a payoff, one will not occur.  However, the profit from purchasing and holding an option could be negative, because a long position entrails a cost, the premium.","Option Premium: An option premium is cost of obtaining an option.  For a long option holder, it entails an expenditure.  For a short option seller, it entails an inflow of income."
6,An American call option gives the owner:,the right but not the obligation to sell the stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date.,the right to buy or sell the stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date.,the right and the obligation to buy the stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date.,the right but not the obligation to buy the stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date.,D,"A) Incorrect. A call option refers to the right to buy underlying securities in the future. Note that, it is not an obligation to exercise the option.
B) Incorrect. See the explanation in part A.
C) Incorrect. See explanation in part A.
D) Correct. Apart from European options, American options allow the purchasers to exercise their rights at anytime.",Option: An option is a derivative that helps investors to protect their capital against the unfavorable movement of the market conditions. There are two types of option: call option and put option.
7,A major disadvantage of using call options to hedge a short position is that _____.,hedging increases the risk of loss on the short sale.,the option premium and commission reduce profit potential.,the price of the stock may go up.,None of the above,B,"A major disadvantage of using call options to hedge a short position is that
b. the option premium and commission reduce profit potential.
A short position loses money if the asset sold increases in price.  To counter this, an investor may purchase a call option on the same asset.  The call option becomes more valuable as the asset price goes up.  To purchase an option, however, the investor must pay an upfront premium, which reduces the profit potential from the short position.  This is the main disadvantage of using options to hedge investment risk.
a. is incorrect because hedging reduces the risk.
c. is incorrect because if the price goes up, the call option will be an advantage, not a disadvantage.
d. is incorrect because of b.","Option Hedging: Option hedging typically involves purchasing options that have the opposite payoff profile from the profile of the asset that the investor is trying to hedge.  For example, if a person owns a stock and is worried about the stock price going down, the person might purchases a put option on the stock.  The value of this option increases as the stock price decreases."
8,"The higher the call option premium, other things being equal, __________ the maturity of the option.",shorter,longer,no impact,,B,"The higher the call option premium, other things being equal, the
b. longer
the maturity of the option.
The option premium (or price) depends on (1) the exercise price, (2) the current asset price, (3) the time to maturity, and (4) the volatility of the asset.  The question specifies that everything else is the same, and only the time to maturity is allowed to change.  Since the option premium is higher, and (1), (2), and (4) are the same, the time to maturity must be higher.  A longer time to maturity increases the call option value because there is more time for the asset price to increase above the strike price.","Maturity: The time to maturity of an option is the time to expiration.  European options can be exercised at maturity only, while American options can be exercised both at maturity and at any time prior to that."
9,Which of the following is a characteristic of put and call options?,They are contracts to buy or sell 100 shares of common stock.,There is always a specified price.,There is always a specified time period to exercise options.,All of the above,A,"a. is true.  One option contract is for the purchase or sale of 100 shares.  Thus, the underlying asset is 100 shares.
b. is true. The specified price in the option contract is called the strike price or the exercise price.  Most stock options are American type options.  They can be exercised by purchasing or selling shares at the specified price at any time before maturity.
c. is true.  The specified time period is the time until the option can be exercised. Every option quote includes the expiration date and exercise price of the option.
The correct answer is d. All of the above","Option Exchanges: Like stocks, most stock options are traded on exchanges.  The first exchange, on which stock options began trading in 1973 was the Chicago Board Option Exchange.(CBOE).  Today stock options are traded on numerous exchanges worldwide."
10,"A put option has an exercise price of {eq}\$40

{/eq} and the put premium is {eq}\$5

{/eq}. The current market price of the underlying stock is {eq}\$38

{/eq}.",Is the option in the money or out of the money?,What is the intrinsic value of the option? The time value?,What is the break-even stock price on the option's expiration date?,"If you purchase this option, what is your maximum possible gain?",A,"The exercise price of the put option is $40 with a put premium of $5. The current market price is $38.
A.
Presently, the option is in the money as the strike price of the put option is greater than the underlying stock price.
B.
The intrinsic value of the option is
= Stock price - Exercise price
= $40 - $38
= $2
The time value represents the volatility of the stock price till the option expires. Here, the information regarding expiration time is not given. So, the time value is zero.
C.
The break-even stock price on the option's expiration date is the expiration price = $40
D.
The maximum possible gain for purchasing this option is
= Stock price - Exercise price
= $40 - $38
= $2
But since the put premium is $5, the holder will incur a loss as the net payoff amounts to $2 - $5 = -$3",Net Pay-off: The net pay-off in options represents the net gain realized from exercising the option. Often a holder realizes that an in-the-money option results in a loss upon exercising because the gain is offset by the amount of premium paid.
11,True or False: Foreign currency options are available both over-the-counter and on organized exchanges.,True,False,,,A,"The statement is
True.
Both over-the-counter (OTC) and regulated exchanges are platforms for trading foreign currency options. In the OTC market, currency options are customized contracts between two parties, while on exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), standardized contracts are traded.","Over the Counter (OTC): OTC market can be described as a market in which direct trading of financial assets is done between two parties, typically via the dealers, and does not have a centralized exchange system."
12,The call-option value of a callable bond is likely to be high when,interest rates are high and expected to remain high.,interest rates are volatile.,markets are inefficient.,interest rates are low and expected to remain low.,B,"Option b, interest rates are volatile
is right.
When interest rates (IR) are volatile, the premium of callable bonds increases as there is a good chance that the call option will end in the money. With an increase in volatility, the BSM Model incorporates a high volatility number, resulting in higher premiums.
Option a: When IR is high, there is a less chance that the instrument will be called. Hence, option a is wrong.
Option c: When markets are inefficient, the price of the instrument may remain low as it does not represent all the public information available in its pricing. Hence, option c is wrong.
Option d: When IR is low, callable bonds will exhibit negative convexity, and there is a high chance that the instrument will be called. Hence, the option is wrong.",Bonds: Bonds are a kind of fixed income instrument that allows an issuer to fund capital for business purposes from potential business with the assurance of interest rate and principal repayment in the future.
13,A protective put written on a portfolio (rather than a single stock) is known as:,portfolio insurance,put-call parity,a warrant,Black-Scholes,A,"The answer is A) portfolio insurance.  Like a protective put, it is a hedging strategy used to limit portfolio losses when stocks decline in value.  However, portfolio insurance does not entail actually selling off stock.  Risk mitigation is achieved by short-selling stock index futures.  The strategy can reduce downside exposure, but it limits gains.","Protective Put: A protective put is an investing strategy whereby a put is purchased (short position) on a stock that is held (long position).  For a premium, the put grants the holder the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying stock.  Essentially, is puts a floor on the price of the stock, but still provides for upside potential."
14,Which of the positions is the riskiest (offers the possibility of the greatest loss)?,Long position (purchase) on call option,Short position (sale) on call option,Long position (purchase) on a put option,Short position (sale) on a put option,B,"Correct Answer:
B
- Short position (sale) on call option.
Explanation:
As the call option itself is riskier than the put option and the short position elaborate that one buys it not for own, which means to sale the call option against such stock which are not even self-owned by the investors contains high risk than any other. The perfect term to give justification is the uncovered security option where premium is considered as the only benefit.
Explanation for Incorrect options:
Option A: It is wrong because generally, investors prefer to hold long position (purchase) on call option to gain more profit as by predicting that the value will increase in future that's why it is the safe option.
Option C: This is incorrect as the long position (purchase) on put option offset any kind of loss occurred on underlying asset through the profit generated when stock value drops. So, this option less risky.
Option D: The short position on the (sale) of put option is risky but the covered put option is less risky which means investor will gain over the option on the short position but it will put the limitation over the potential gain in the same period.",Call and Put Option: Call option is the option which grant right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying security with in the pre-mentioned time while put option grant right but not obligation to sell the underlying security with in the pre- mentioned time frame.
15,"True or False: A call option gives the owner the right to purchase a fixed number of shares at a specified price, but no right to receive dividends paid during the life of the option.",True,False,,,A,"The statement is
TRUE.
By purchasing a call option, a buyer is eligible for a right to acquire the underlying assets or securities at a predetermined price in the future. Thus, the ownership will not be established as long as the option is not exercised. Consequently, a call option holder will not receive dividends from underlying shares during the life of the option since they are not holding these shares.","Option: An option is a common derivative for hedging against an unfavorable change in the price of an asset. In practice, there are two types of options: call option and put option."
16,Suppose that a stock sells at a price of $60 on the expiration date. Compute the payoff to the seller of a call option if the option strike price is $20.,-$20,-$30,-$40,-$50,C,"The answer is
C)-$40
The seller of a call option will have to sell underlying securities to the option holder at the strike price if the option holder decides to exercise the option. In the case that market price of security is greater than the strike price, the option seller will engage a loss.
Loss = Market price - Strike price = $60 - $20 = $40",Call Option: A call option is attached with a right to buy underlying securities at a predetermined price in the future. Purchasing a call option would be ideal when the price of security is expected to increase.

With a stock price of $20 and a call at $20 will result in $0 value (20 - 20 = 0). At this stock price, the purchase of a $20 call would result in a loss of -$2 since the price of a $20 call at a strike of $20 is $2. The value of call at $15 is $5 which is the price of the call at $15. After selling the $15 option, there will be $0 profit. As a result, the net profit (loss) = -$2 (profit of call at $20) + $0 profit of call at $15 = -$2.
With a stock price of $25 and a call at $20 will result in $5 value (25 stock price - 20 call strike price = 5). At this stock price, the purchase of a $20 call would result in a profit of $3 ($5 Value of Call at $20 - $2 Price of Call at $20 = $3). The value of call at $15 ($25 stock price - $15 strike price call = 10). After selling the $15 option, there will be -$5 loss ($10 value of $15 call price - $15 price of call = -5). As a result, the net profit (loss) = -$2 (-$5 Profit of Call at $15 + $3 profit of call at $20 = -$2)

The profit of the call at $15 is -$5 which is the price of the call at $15. As a result, the net loss is -$3 (-$5 profit of call at $20 + $2 profit of call at $15)
With a stock price of $20 and a call at $20 will result in $0 value (20 - 20 = 0).

22,"If an investor writes an ABC stock put and the option is exercised, the investor must:",Receive cash,Deliver cash,Buy stock,Deliver stock,C,"The correct answer is
c. Buy stock
.
A put option is a contract that allows you to sell a specific amount of an asset, like stocks, at a set price, called the strike price, within a certain time.
There are two main parties in a put option:
Buyer: This person pays a fee, called a premium, to get the option. It gives a right to sell the asset at the strike price. The buyer can make money using the option if the market price drops.
Seller: This person sells (writes) the put option, receiving the premium from the buyer, and if the buyer decides to exercise the put, the seller is obligated to buy the asset at the strike price. The seller benefits if the option isn't used, meaning the market price stays above the strike price.
Based on the explanation above, the investor is the seller who writes an ABC stock put. When the put is exercised, the investor must buy the stock at the set price, making all other options incorrect

B .
Explanation for the correct answer:
The delta of a European styled option actually rises and does not move towards zero when the price of the stock rises as it is positively co-related.
Explanation for the incorrect answers:
The following statements are the correct statements:
Option: A - The Vega of a European call option is highest when the option is at-the-money because its sensitivity will be at the implied volatility. Due to the implications of the time value of money, Vega will be at its highest as long as its expiration.
Option: C- The gamma of the European option at the money increases when the remaining maturity of the option decreases because the European option can be exercised at its maturity only, unlike the American option, making the value increasing as the maturity comes closer.
Option: D-  Compared to an at-the-money European-styled call option, an out-of-the-money European-styled option with the same strike price and remaining maturity has a greater negative value for theta because the European style option will not react to price changes when the strike price matches, that makes theta negative.","European Call-Put Option: European call and put options are the contracts that can be executed on the maturity date only.

A. is incorrect because the terms European and American do not refer to the trading venue.
C. is incorrect. American options are worth more because they can be exercised at any time until maturitiy.
D. is incorrect because the exercise price of both types of options is fixed.","Exercise Price: The exercise price is one of the most important components of an options contract.

When an underlying asset's spot price is higher than the strike price for a put option, it is said to be ""out of the money"". This is because if buyers exercised the option, they would be able to sell the underlying assets for less money.
For example, if a put option's strike price is $70 per share and the stock's market price is $85 per share, the option is out of the money, since its holder cannot profitably exercise it at this time.

D. Low of $38 and high of $62.
To answer this problem, we must compute the change in stock price to get the binomial spread of possible stock prices. Accordingly, we know that:
Option Delta = Change in option price / change in stock price, therefore,
Change in stock price = change in option price / Option Delta
Change in Option Price = $12
Option Delta = 0.30
Change in stock price = $12 / 0.30

unlimited
.
The situation of loss to a seller occurs when the price starts going up and goes above the agreed price. The loss linked to the seller is unlimited since the asset price can rise to infinity. Hence, option D is valid.
The explanations for incorrect options are as follows:
Option A: equal to the call premium: To acquire the right associated with a call option, a buyer is required to pay some amount to the seller, which is in the form of a premium. In the case of the seller, the maximum profit is equal to the amount received and not the maximum loss. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the loss is equal to the call premium due to the situation of potentially unlimited loss. Hence, option A is incorrect.
Option B: larger the lower the stock price: It is also incorrect since profit is generated for a seller when the price falls.
Option C: limited: It is incorrect since the potential loss is unlimited.","Call Option: A call option provides a choice under which a buyer has the right to acquire or buy an asset. The choice is exercised only when it is beneficial for the option buyer. However, there is no compulsion on the buyer to exercise the option, since the buyer receives a choice and not an obligation."
