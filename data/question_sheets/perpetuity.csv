The practical aspect of perpetuities is very limited but it is an important concept to master the understanding of the time value of money on which, business finance is based."
2,Which securities has the pattern of cash flows of perpetuities?,Common shares.,Preferred shares.,Corporate bonds.,Government bonds.,B,"The answer is
b) Preferred shares
.
The pattern of cash flows of perpetuity is cash inflows would last forever.
The preferred stockholders would receive the annual dividend as long as they keep the ownership of these shares. Thus, it represents the pattern of perpetuity if the preferred shares are held forever.
Common stock might not pay out the dividends if there are some upcoming plans that require a large volume of capital. The firm would retain the net income to support those projects.
Both corporate and government bonds would pay the interest payments until the maturity. There would be no subsequent cash flows after the maturity date.",Perpetuity: A perpetuity is a fixed-income security that investors would be able to gain an infinite stream of payments. The value of a perpetuity is subjective to the changes in the market interest rates.

True
The evaluation of the value of a property is done by the capitalization of net income by dividing periodic payment by desired return or interest rates. With higher interest rates, the value for upcoming payments starts falling. This lowers the value of the perpetuity.",Perpetuity: Perpetuity is an annual payment that has no maturity as there is no finite period of time for the payments. The most appropriate example for perpetuity is a payment of dividends on equity shares that are continuously paid until the winding up of the firm.

20,Most loans are a form of perpetuity. True or False?,True,False,,,B,"False
Most loans are a form of perpetuity are a false statement. In finance, the cash flows associated with various types of investments can be a lump sum, an annuity, or uneven cash flows. An annuity is a fixed amount of payment made each period for example in the case of a fixed-rate loan. The term perpetuity is an annuity that occurs infinitely. Loans in most cases have a defined life period hence they are not perpetuities.","Loans: Loans are funds provided by a lender to a borrower to facilitate the financing of a project or asset. The borrower will pay back the loan plus the interest charged by the lender. The payments are in installments and will be determined based on the features of the loan and the time value of money equations. The features include; loan amount, loan life period, and interest rate."
21,The duration of perpetuity varies _____ with interest rates.,inversely,concavely,convexly,,A,"Option a is the correct answer
Reason:
There is a negative relationship between interest rate and perpetuity securities since these types of securities offer fixed interest rate and becomes more welcoming when the interest rate in the market decreases.
Reason for incorrect option:
Option (b) Concavely:
The word Concavely is not used in terms of Perpetuity. Rather it is mostly used in mathematics.
Option (c) Convexly:
Securities bearing a convex relationship with interest rate tend to decrease with the decrease in the price of the securities.
Option (d) Directly:
Since the security price is fixed with no maturity date and these securities do not pay regular interest like zero-coupon bonds. Therefore, bonds do not have a direct relationship with the interest rate.","Perpetuity Securities: Perpetuity securities are those bonds that do not have a maturity date. The obligation to repay the principal amount of perpetuity securities is not necessary. Generally, these types of securities are treated as equity and not debt."

In practice, its payments can grow at a constant rate to overcome the effects of the inflation rate in the economy, Or, a stream of growing payments is to protect the purchasing power of money."
38,An annuity that involves equal periodic payments without end is called:,An annuity due.,A perpetuity.,An interest-only loan.,Taxes.,B,"b) A perpetuity.
An annuity that involves equal periodic payments without end is called
perpetuity
.
An annuity is a fixed payment made on a regular basis for a set period of time. An annuity may be either an ordinary annuity or an annuity due. Payments for the ordinary annuity will be made at the end of each period, while payments for the annuity due will be made at the beginning of each period. A perpetuity is a form of annuity where payments occur forever.","Investment Cash flows: An investment is an opportunity that requires incurring a cost today in order to receive future economic benefits. An investment's cash flows may be a lump sum, a sequence of unequal cash flows, or an annuity. The cash flows, risk, return, and investment duration are all factors considered when determining the value of an investment."
39,"What is the present value of a growing perpetuity that has an initial payment of $20,000 one year from now? Assume a growth rate of 5% and a rate of return equal to 9%.","$50,000.00","$500,000.00","$222,222,22","$400,000.00",B,"The correct answer is
option b. $500,000.
Given information:
Initial Payment at the end of year: $20,000
Growth rate: 5%
Rate of return: 9%
Determine the perpetuity by dividing the initial payment at the end of the year by the difference between the rate of return and growth rate.
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Value of growing perpetuity} &=\frac{\text{Initial payment at the end of the year}}{\text{Rate of return}-\text{Growth rate}} \\ &=\frac{\$20,000}{9\%-5\%} \\ &=\frac{\$20,000}{4\%} \\ &=\$500,000 \end{aligned} {/eq}
Hence, the value of growing perpetuity is $500,000.",Perpetual Payments: Perpetual payments are a type of annuity wherein an individual chooses to make a fixed payment at a fixed interval but for an infinite duration. Growing perpetual payments means that the fixed payment increases by a fixed rate every time.
40,Which of the following is used as the denominator while calculating the present value for a growing perpetuity that begins the next period (PVP)?,The difference between i (the discount or interest rate) and g (the constant rate of growth of the cash flow),i (the discount or interest rate),g (the constant rate of growth of the cash flow),The addition of i (the discount or interest rate) and g (the constant rate of growth of the cash flow),A,"Present value formula for growing perpetuity:
{eq}\text{Value} = \displaystyle \frac{\text{Payment}}{\text{Required rate of return} - \text{Growth rate}} {/eq}
According to the present value formula for growing perpetuity, the correct answer should be
A. The difference between i (the discount or interest rate) and g (the constant rate of growth of the cash flow).
Incorrect answers:
B. i (the discount or interest rate):
The growth rate for cash flows should be not ignored.
C. g (the constant rate of growth of the cash flow):
The required rate of return or the discount rate must be considered in the discount factor.
D. The addition of i (the discount or interest rate) and g (the constant rate of growth of the cash flow)
: Generally, if cash flows grow quickly, the present value of all cash flows become larger. However, the addition of discount rate and the growth rate will lower the present value of cash flows, which is irrelevant.","Perpetuity: Perpetuity will provide a stream of payments to an investor indefinitely. Generally, periodic payments on perpetuity are constant. However, an investor might acquire a growing perpetuity to protect the purchasing power of money from the inflation."
41,Most loans are a form of perpetuity. True or False?,True,False,,,B,"False
Most loans are a form of perpetuity are a false statement. In finance, the cash flows associated with various types of investments can be a lump sum, an annuity, or uneven cash flows. An annuity is a fixed amount of payment made each period for example in the case of a fixed-rate loan. The term perpetuity is an annuity that occurs infinitely. Loans in most cases have a defined life period hence they are not perpetuities.","Loans: Loans are funds provided by a lender to a borrower to facilitate the financing of a project or asset. The borrower will pay back the loan plus the interest charged by the lender. The payments are in installments and will be determined based on the features of the loan and the time value of money equations. The features include; loan amount, loan life period, and interest rate."
42,"If perpetuity has a price of $500 and an annual interest payment of $25, the interest rate is:",2.5 percent.,5 percent.,7.5 percent.,10 percent.,B,"The correct option is B)
The formula to calculate the present value of a perpetuity is:
Present value = Cash flow / Interest rate. The present value is the price of the investment and the cash flow is equal to the annual interest payment, so we can therefore calculate the interest rate like this:
$500 = $25 / Interest Rate
Interest Rate  = $25 / $500
Interert rate = 0.05 or 5%","Perpetuity: A  perpetuity is an infinite stream of cash flows. To calculate the present value of this stream, the amount of the cash flows and the discount rate that applies to the payor or recipient are used. For an investor in a perpetuity, the interest rate is the same as the yield of the investment."
43,"The Alkins Brothers recently established a trust fund that will provide annual scholarships of $10,000 indefinitely. These annual scholarships are:",An ordinary annuity.,an annuity due.,amortized payments.,a perpetuity.,D,"The answer is
D. a perpetuity
.
Since scholarships are to be provided for an indefinite amount of time, we should consider them as perpetuity. A perpetuity is a sequence of equal cash flows that are evenly-spaced and have no ending date. Perpetuity differs from an annuity in that it has no end.",Time Value of Money: The time value of money theory gives us the base for financial concepts such as the present and future value. These concepts also apply to the streams of cash flows like annuities and perpetuities.
44,What is the term used to describe an annuity with an infinite life?,Perpetuity.,Infinuity.,Infinity due.,There is no special term for an infinite annuity.,A,"The correct choice is
a. Perpetuity.
The term used to describe an annuity with an infinite life is
perpetuity
A perpetuity is referred to as a special form of annuity. An annuity has a set time period; for example, you can purchase an annuity that will pay you for the next twenty years. A perpetuity, on the other hand, is infinite, implying that the cash flows will continue forever. We can calculate the present value of a perpetuity, but not its future value because it occurs indefinitely. The annuity amount and the rate of return are considered in the present value computations.","Types of cash flows: Before making an investment, an investor considers a variety of factors. The cash flows, required rate of return, useful life of the investment, and risk level are all factors to consider. Cash flows can be a single payment or a series of payments. An annuity is defined as multiple payments of the same amount at regular time intervals. The timing of the cash flow determines whether the annuity is an ordinary annuity or annuity due."
45,"What is the present value (PV) of an investment that will pay $400 in one year's time, and $400 every year after that, when the interest rate is 5%?","$2,400","$3,600","$7,200","$8,000",D,"The correct answer is option
d. $8,000
