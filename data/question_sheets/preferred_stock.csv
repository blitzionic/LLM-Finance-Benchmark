1,Preferred stock is included in the calculation of Net financial obligations (NFO).,True,False,,,B,"False
Net Financial Obligations (NFO) do not include preferred stock. In most cases, NFO consists of both short-term and long-term debt obligations, minus liquid assets. Preferred stock combines features of debt and equity into a single security. However, it is not a debt obligation but rather an equity instrument. NFO, which takes debt obligations into account, excludes preferred stock because it is more concerned with meeting those obligations.",Preferred Stock: Preference stock gives preference to the holder to get compensated when the company is liquidated. The preferred stockholders also claim ahead of the common stockholders on the earnings and assets of a business.
2,A high proportion of the value of a growth stock comes from:,Past dividend payments.,Past earnings.,PVGO (Present Value of the Growth Opportunities).,Both A and B.,C,"The correct option is C. PVGO (Present Value of the Growth Opportunities)
Explanation:
The growth stock's value completely depends on expectations formed among the shareholders. These shareholders invest in growth stock by calculating the present value (PV) of the growth opportunities (GO). The shareholders are certain because they analyze the PVGO of the stock. The shareholders pay a higher price for the growth stock because they expect it to grow at a higher rate.
A high proportion of the value of a growth stock comes from
PVGO (Present Value of the Growth Opportunities)
Explanation for incorrect options:
The high proportion of the value of a growth stock does not come from past dividend payments, past earnings, or both.
A. Past dividend payments.
dividend payment depends on the company's earnings and is not fixed yearly. It depends on the market conditions, the peak season, etc. Therefore, a shareholder cannot expect a high proportion by analyzing past dividend payments as it is dynamic.
B. Past earnings
a company's earnings are not stable and keep fluctuating depending on the operations performed, new technology introduced, an entry in a new market, and various other factors. Therefore, a shareholder cannot ascertain a high proportion by studying the company's past earnings.
D. Both A and B.
Since option A and option B, the shareholders cannot analyze the high proportion value of the stock, so option D is also incorrect.",Stock: A stock refers to a document that details the ownership of an individual in the company where stock is purchased. The stock is bought and sold on the stock exchange per government regulations.

4,Common stockholders have a residual claim to income in other words they are last in line.,True,False,,,A,"The given statement is
true.
A company, in order to support its overall activities, requires capital that can be raised from different alternatives such as common equity, debt, and preferred stock.
Holders of debt who provide capital to the company generally receive a return, which is in the form of interest, and they will receive it irrespective of whether the firm has sufficient funds to honor its due obligations or not. Similarly, the preferred stockholders also receive a return but it is paid out of those profits that are left after paying the necessary tax obligations. The return to both common as well as preferred stockholders that it receives from the company is always in the form of dividends. However, the claim of common shareholders is at the bottom of the priority list, and their claim is purely residual, meaning that they only receive the leftover amount after clearing out all claims from the company's assets.
Among the three capital providers, the first priority is always given to the debtholders as their claim is superior and secured. The next on the line is preferred shareholders which is a hybrid of both common shares and debt. Lastly, once other capital providers' claims are paid off, the common shareholders receive their claim if there is anything left for them.
Hence, the provided statement is true.","Common Stockholders: Investors who purchase the common equity shares of any company not only become the holders of those shares but also the company's true owners, and they are known as common stockholders. By purchasing common shares, the investors receive a right to participate in the profit-sharing among them, based on their holding weight in the company."
5,Firm X has a tax rate of 27%. The price of its new preferred stock is $69 and its flotation cost is $2. The cost of new preferred stock is 14%. What is the firm's dividend?,$11.53,$9.38,$10.83,$8.03,B,"The correct answer is
b. $9.38.
Given information:
Price (P0) = $69
Flotation cost = $2
Cost of new preferred stock = 14%
The corporate income tax is not considered in this case since dividends are paid from after-tax income.
Estimate the dividend for the new preferred stock:
{eq}\text{Dividend} = \displaystyle \text{Cost of new preferred stock} \times (\text{P0} - \text{Flotation cost}) \\ \text{Dividend} = \displaystyle 14\% \times (\$69 - \$2) \\ \text{Dividend} = \$9.38 {/eq}","Dividends: A dividend payment is a capital distribution to a corporation's owners within a year.

a. Preferred stock generally pays a fixed dividend.
It is true that preferred stock pays fixed dividends at the stated rate.
b. Preferred stock is perpetuity.
It is perpetuity because it pays constant dividends to the shareholders until the business exists.
c. Dividends on preferred stock are tax deductible.
It is a false statement because preferred dividends are taxable both in the hands of the corporation and in the hands of the shareholders.

9,A stock's beta is more relevant as a measure of risk to an investor with a well-diversified portfolio than to an investor who holds only one stock.,True,False,,,A,"The given statement, 'A stock's beta is more relevant as a measure of risk to an investor with a well-diversified portfolio than to an investor who holds only one stock' is
a. true
.
The sensitivity of a stock's returns to those of the entire market is measured by its beta. A stock with a beta of 1 follows the market's movements, whereas a beta greater than 1 is more volatile, and a beta of less than 1 is less volatile.
When the investor's portfolio is already well-diversified across various equities and asset classes, the beta of a particular stock becomes more important as a gauge of risk for the investor. As a result, the investor is more interested in how the return on a single stock will change concerning the market as a whole. Contrarily, an investor who owns just one stock is subject to idiosyncratic or company-specific risk, which beta does not account for. In this instance, the investor is more concerned with the company's unique risk than with the stock's performance in the market.",Stock Portfolio: A stock portfolio is a set of stocks or other securities an individual or a fund holds. The objective of a stock portfolio is to diversify the holdings to control risk and possibly optimize returns.

11,The earnings per share is computed for what type of stock?,Common stock.,Nonredeemable preferred.,Redeemable preferred.,Common stock and fully diluted preferred stock.,A,"The correct option is
a. Common stock.
Earnings per share (EPS) is a financial indicator that quantifies a company's profitability by revealing how much of the company's net income is distributed to each outstanding share of common stock. It is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to common shareholders by the diluted share count as of the end of the calculation period.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
b. Nonredeemable preferred. Preferred stock is a subset of a company's stock that typically has a higher dividend rate and dividend priority over common stock. Preference shares that cannot be converted into cash are excluded from earnings-per-share calculations.
c. Redeemable preferred. Redeemable preferred stock is preferred stock that can be repurchased by the company at a predetermined price. Earnings per share (EPS) are not calculated for this stock, as is the case with nonredeemable preferred stock.
d. Common stock and fully diluted preferred stock. While fully diluted preferred stock could be factored into an EPS calculation, doing so would be inaccurate. In the case of fully diluted preferred stock, all convertible securities are factored into the earnings per share calculation, which isn't always the case.","Stock: The investors invest in the stock or share, which is a type of security where they purchase the shares of a company and get ownership rights in the company to the extent of their holding."

The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
A. generally have voting rights
Preferred shares generally do not have voting rights.
B. are guaranteed that they will not have a loss on their investment
There is no guarantee that a preferred shareholder will not lose their investment in case of liquidation. Preferred shareholders have a preferred right to the assets of the company over common shareholders but only after creditors have been paid, and if the remaining assets are worth less than the par value for preferred stock, preferred shareholders will have a loss on their investment.
C. have more investment risk compared to common stockholders
No, preferred shareholders have less risk because they have preferred rights to dividends and assets in case of liquidation.
D. receive a dividend preference over common stockholders
This is the correct alternative because when a company declares dividends the preferred shareholders have the first, but limited, right to their dividend payment.",Preferred Stockholders: The preferred stockholders of a company are the owners of the preferred stock class. They do not have the same rights and risks as the common shareholders and preferred shares are therefore often called hybrid-equity financing.

This statement is not correct because preferred stocks have less priority than debt. A firm's earnings must be used to pay interest payments before paying dividends to preferred stockholders. Even during liquidation, creditors are prioritized over equity investors.

A common stock gives the investor the right to vote on major issues concerning the company, such as electing board members, approving mergers and acquisitions, and other significant corporate decisions. Common stockholders, usually have one vote per share of stock they own, allowing them to have a say in the company's governance.
Incorrect Options
A. Corporate bond: A corporate bond is a debt security issued by a company to raise capital. Bondholders are considered creditors and do not have voting rights in the company's decisions.
B. Mutual fund: A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. Investors in a mutual fund own shares of the fund, not the underlying assets, and thus do not have direct voting rights in the individual companies within the fund's portfolio.

31,Preferred stockholders:,receive a set percentage of corporation net income.,are guaranteed that they will not have a loss on their investment.,receive a dividend preference over common stockholders.,are guaranteed to receive an annual dividend payment.,C,"The correct option is
C. receive a dividend preference over common stockholders
In comparison to common stockholders, preferred stockholders are given a dividend preference, which means they receive dividends more quickly. As a result of this provision, dividends to preferred stockholders will always be paid out ahead of dividends to common stockholders. This guarantees a higher payout rate and gives you preferential treatment when dividends are distributed.
The explanation for the correct option:
A. receive a set percentage of corporation net income: Preferred stockholders are not always entitled to a certain share of the company's net profit. Preferred stock dividends are typically a set dollar amount or a set percentage of the stock's face value, rather than a percentage of the company's net income.
B. are guaranteed that they will not have a loss on their investment: Preferred stockholders are not safe from financial losses. There is still the possibility that their investment could go down in value if the company runs into financial trouble.
D. are guaranteed to receive an annual dividend payment: Annual dividend payments to preferred stockholders are not guaranteed. Preferred stock dividends are typically paid on a quarterly or annual basis, but the exact timing and amount of these payments can vary.","Common Stock: The common shareholders are the owners of the company, have voting rights, and generally do not have priority in the distribution of income.

A. A stock split increases total owners' equity.
A stock split has no effect on the total equity of the company's owners. It's as simple as increasing the total number of shares in circulation while simultaneously lowering the price per share. This means that owners' equity (representing the market value of all shares) has not changed.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
B. A stock split involves a reduction in the share's issue value:
The price per share or issue value is reduced when a stock is split, making the stock more affordable for retail investors.
C. A stock split is an increase in the number of authorized, issued, and outstanding shares:
Stock market liquidity can improve after a stock split because more of the company's shares will be floating around.
D. A stock split decreases the market price of the shares:
The market value of a company's shares drops after a stock split, making those shares more affordable for potential buyers. The market cap (the sum of all shareholders' equity) has not changed.","Stock Split: When the share price of the company is too high or demand is high and supply is low, the existing shares are split into many parts to increase the number of shares.

41,Common stockholders have a residual claim to income in other words they are last in line.,True,False,,,A,"The given statement is
true.
A company, in order to support its overall activities, requires capital that can be raised from different alternatives such as common equity, debt, and preferred stock.
Holders of debt who provide capital to the company generally receive a return, which is in the form of interest, and they will receive it irrespective of whether the firm has sufficient funds to honor its due obligations or not. Similarly, the preferred stockholders also receive a return but it is paid out of those profits that are left after paying the necessary tax obligations. The return to both common as well as preferred stockholders that it receives from the company is always in the form of dividends. However, the claim of common shareholders is at the bottom of the priority list, and their claim is purely residual, meaning that they only receive the leftover amount after clearing out all claims from the company's assets.
Among the three capital providers, the first priority is always given to the debtholders as their claim is superior and secured. The next on the line is preferred shareholders which is a hybrid of both common shares and debt. Lastly, once other capital providers' claims are paid off, the common shareholders receive their claim if there is anything left for them.

b. $400,000 in the Common Stock account
Given information:
Number of shares = 10,000
Par value = No par value
Net proceeds per share = $40
If stocks are issued without par value, the common stock account will be credited while the cash account is debited at the same amount of net proceeds. The paid-in capital in excess of par does not exist in this case.
Estimate the amount of money to credited to the common stock account:
{eq}\text{Reported amount} = \text{Net proceeds} \times \text{N} \\ \text{Reported amount} = \$40 \times 10,000 \\ \text{Reported amount} = \$400,000 {/eq}","Common Stocks: Common stocks are equity securities that a firm can sell to the public to raise additional equity capital. The cost of new common equity is greater than the cost of existing equity capital due to the flotation costs. Compared to a new issue of bonds, the firm is not required to repay the principal to investors if new common stocks are issued."
