1,Which of the following statements is false?,"U.S. Treasuries are never subject to interest rate risk unless we select a maturity equal to our investment horizon.B. Many practitioners analyze other financial characteristics of a firm, when they forecast betas.C. When using historical returns to forecast future betas, we must be mindful of changes in the environment that might cause the future to differ from the past.D. If a firm were to change industries, using its historical beta would be inferior to using the beta of other firms in the new industry.",,,,A,"The FALSE statement is
(A.) U.S. Treasuries are never subject to interest rate risk unless we select a maturity equal to our investment horizon.
All bonds are subject to interest rate risk including U.S. Treasury bonds. U.S. Treasury bonds are considered to be long-term bonds that mature over 10-30 years. Long-term bonds, specifically, have a higher interest rate risk. Therefore, Option (A) is a false statement.
Option B is incorrect because it is true that many practitioners analyze other financial characteristics of a firm when they forecast betas. When practitioners forecast betas, they analyze many financial characteristics that may have an effect on the beta measurement such as market changes related to inflation, consumer spending, increased competition, etc.
Option C is incorrect because it is true that changes in the environment may cause the future to be different from the past and we must be mindful of those changes when using historical returns to forecast future betas. For example, inflation or consumer spending may be higher in the future compared to the past. These factors will have an effect on forecasted future betas
Option D is incorrect because it is true if a firm were to change industries, it would be inferior to use its historical beta rather than using the beta of other firms in the new industry. If a company uses its historical beta upon changing to a new industry, this beta would be an inefficient measure as the historical beta would only measure the company's volatility within the previous industry, not in the new one. It would be more effective to use the beta of other firms in the new industry because this beta would measure the risk that is relevant within the new industry.","Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is related to all bonds in the market. The risk refers to the change in interest rates which may lower the value of the bond. As a result, the bond's price will change as a result of changes to the interest rates."
2,Which of the following are accurate statements about interest rate risk?,It arises when the banking system was heavily regulated.,Banks must manage interest rate risk because it affects banks' expenses.,Changes in interest rates affect bank liabilities.,"Although interest rate risk does not affect banks' interest income, it affects their interest expenses.",C,"The correct answer is C. Changes in interest rates affect bank liabilities.
A fluctuation in interest charges directly affects the value of a bank's statements, especially the balance sheet on assets and liabilities within the given period. When interest rates rise, causing the value of assets to increase and the value of the liabilities to be retained, this will reduce the net worth of the company. This change affects the bank's overall value and the income received within that given period. Interest rates often change when a country is aiming at regulating the amount of money in circulation in the economy. It can also rise to reduce the rate of borrowing hence reducing the rate of income received by the banks and other financial institutions within that period.",Interest Rates Risk: Interest rate risk can be defined as the possibility of investment to undergo a loss due to changes that may occur on interest rates. The loss may occur when interest rates decline or incline within a given period affecting some of the most significant financial assets like an increase in interest rates may cause a fall in the value of the bond.
3,Which one of the following bonds would be likely to exhibit a greater degree of interest rate risk?,A zero-coupon bond with 20 years until maturity,A coupon-paying bond with 20 years until maturity,A floating-rate bond with 20 years until maturity,A zero-coupon bond with 30 years until maturity,D,"Option d. is the correct answer.
The bond's interest rate is directly influenced by the coupon rate on the bonds and the bond term. There is a direct impact of the time on the interest rates. When the period is more, the security is exposed to probability for a more extended period, resulting in a higher interest rate. So in the case of 30 years to maturity is highest than all other cases, so the interest rate will be highest.
In the case of coupon rates, there is opposite relation; when the coupon rate is lower, the bonds have more interest rates, so in the case of zero-coupon bonds, the coupon rate is most lacking, so the interest rate is most will be highest.
Incorrect options:
Option a, b and c are incorrect as all these have higher coupons than zero-coupon bonds and the term period is lesser than 30 years, which is the longest term in this case.","Interest rate risk: The risk that the investment and security have to face is due to fluctuation in the interest over a period. The interest rate varies due to several market factors, which can reduce the asset's actual value and cause losses to the firm."
4,Which of the following bonds has the greatest interest rate risk?,"a 5 year, 10% coupon bond","a 10 year, 10% coupon bond","a 5 year, 5% coupon bond","a 10 year, 5% coupon bond",D,"The correct answer is
d. a 10 year, 5% coupon bond
.
The longer the maturity of a bond, the higher its interest rate risk. The bond with the longest maturity and lowest coupon rate has the highest interest rate risk. The other options are incorrect because bond c. has a shorter maturity, bond b. has a higher coupon rate, and bond a. has both.
To see this, let us use an exaggerated example. Consider two bonds. Bond A matures today. Bond B matures in 5 years.  Both bonds have no coupons. Suppose interest rates increase from 0% to 1%. The price of bond A will remain unchanged because it matures today and the rate at which its payment is discounted does not matter. Bond B, on the other hand, will fall in price because its payment will be discounted for 5 years at the higher interest rate. Thus, the price of the longer maturity bond is more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Similarly, the smaller the coupon rate, the higher the interest rate risk. Consider another extreme example. Bond A pays a coupon of $999 today and repays $1 next year, while bond B pays $1,000 next year. Any increase in the interest rate will affect the price of bond B much more than the price of A because most of the value of bond B comes from the future and the discount rate affects the present value of future payments.",Interest Rate Risk: This is the risk that the bond's price will change as a result of changing interest rates. This risk can be measured using the modified duration formula. This formula provides the percentage change in the bond price for a one percent increase in interest rates.
5,Which of the following bonds has the greatest interest rate price risk?,"A 10-year, $1,000 face value, zero-coupon bondb. A 10-year, $1,000 face value, 10% coupon bond with annual interest paymentsc. All 10-year bonds have the same price risk since they have the same maturityd. A 10-year, $1,000 face value, 10% coupon bond with semiannual interest payments",,,,A,"(a.) A 10-year, $1,000 face value, zero-coupon bond
has the greatest interest rate price risk.
A bond's interest rate risk depends mainly on two factors: the period to maturity and coupon payments. All the bonds have the same period to maturity (10 years), however, they differ in terms of coupon payments. Two bonds have regular (annual or semiannual) interest payments while the zero-coupon bond has no interest payments. In the case of a zero-coupon bond, all the income resulting from the discount comes at maturity and due to this reason, such a bond is subject to a greater interest rate risk than bonds with the same maturity but generating coupon payments.","Interest Rate Risk: The interest rate risk is the probability of incurring a loss or generating an extra income as a result of a change in interest rate. Market rates of interest influence the prices of some financial instruments, mainly bonds."
6,"A ""liquidity trap"" is",what always happens after a stock-market crash.,effectively modelled by assuming an horizontal LM curve.,the result of the central bank rigidly controlling interest rates.,all of the above.,D,"Part a
A crash of the securities market generally results in lower interest rates. At such a lower rate of interest and uncertainty accompanied by securities, people will want to hold onto the liquid form of money rather than invest in any type of security. This implies signs of LT.
Part b
In the case of LT, the money demand is considered infinite for the given interest rate. It is because at a lower interest rate, people will want to reserve liquid money rather than invest in bonds and no monetary policy has any alteration effect in such a market situation. This results in a horizontal LM curve.
Part c
The CB (central bank) tends to reduce the interest rate to zero to stimulate borrowing and increase the MS (money supply) in the economy. The higher the MS, the higher are the chances of investments, production activities, and aggregate demand. Although after a certain point in time, this policy tends to fail as people start reserving money to counter expected crises rather than investing it for fostering economic activities. This eventually lowers economic productivity and the economy moves toward recession, implying the LT situation.
Part d
All the mentioned points fulfill the requirements of being the related factors to LT.",Liquidity trap: The liquidity trap (LT) is a market scenario wherein people tend to hold onto money at a determined market rate of interest and are not ready to invest in bonds after a certain decline in the interest rate. This is because the people are uncertain about the expected crisis and want to hold onto money rather than bonds because the former has an exchange value even if the interest rates reduce to zero.
7,"Given relatively stable financial market conditions, determine which one of the following bonds would exhibit the least price volatility. Briefly, explain why.","15-year, 15% coupon bond","5-year, 10% coupon bond","15-year, 10% coupon bond","5-year, 15% coupon bond",D,"The answer is d).
A bond with a shorter duration will have a smaller volatility in price with respect to changes in interest rate. We can apply the following facts about duration:
1) All else the same, duration increases with time to maturity
2) All else the same, duration declines with coupon rate
Applying 2) we know that:
duration of 15-year, 15% bond < duration of 15-year, 10% bond
duration of 5-year, 15% bond < duration of 5-year, 10% bond
Applying 1), we know:
duration of 5-year, 15% bond < duration of 15-year, 15% bond
Thus, the duration of the 5-year, 15% bond is the shortest, and thus has the lowest volatility in price.","Duration and Interest Rate Risk: The duration of a cash flow is the present value of the the cash flows' maturity. When applied to a bond, the duration of a bond is a useful measure of its interest rate risk, i.e., how sensitive bond price is with respect to changes in interest rate."

The term interest rate risk refers to the risk that an investor faces when the interest rate on a particular asset changes. Thus, it can be inferred as the risk associated with the return of an asset/security when its interest rate changes.","Interest Rate: In economics, the term interest rate refers to the rate of return on a particular asset or security.

14,Which of the following are the three factors explaining the risk structure of interest rates?,"liquidity, default risk, and the income tax treatment of a security","maturity, default risk, and the income tax treatment of a security","maturity, liquidity, and the income tax treatment of a security","maturity, default risk, and the liquidity of a security",A,"The correct answer is option A. liquidity, default risk, and the income tax treatment of security.
The three factors explaining the risk structure of interest rates are
liquidity,
Default risk
The income tax treatment of security
The term ""liquidity"" describes how quickly security may be acquired or traded without changing its price, and easily tradable securities used to have smaller gains and interest rates because they are less risky.
The possibility that the debtor would miss payments or refuse to pay back the principal and interest due on security is known as default risk, impacting interest rates.
The income tax treatment of security refers to how the security is taxed. Municipal bonds, for instance that are free from taxation by the federal government typically have a lower yield because investors find them more appealing.","Risk Structure: The risk structure shows the connection between the interest earnings on diverse securities of the same maturity but with different risk levels, allowing one to determine the cost of borrowing."
15,"Holding all other variables constant, an increase in the interest rate will cause _____ to decrease.",Future values,Present values,Annuity payments,Growth rates,D,"The correct answer is:
d. Growth rates
An increase in interest rates increases the cost of borrowing while reducing the disposable income of consumers. The increased borrowing cost and consumers' disposable income reduce consumer spending, which causes the
growth rates to decrease.
Future values
grow when the interest rate is increased
Present values
are reduced or lowered when the interest rate is increased
Annuity payments.
If the interest rate increase, annuity payments are expected to rise.","INTEREST RATE The interest rate is the amount earned from an investment or lending money. It is given as a percentage of the borrowed or invested amount, also known as the principle."
16,Duration captures one important aspects of interest rate risk. Namely:,the price risk deriving from a large shift in the term structure.,the price risk deriving from a twist movement in the term structure.,the price risk deriving from a butterfly movement in the term structure.,the price risk deriving from a small shift in the yield term structure.,D,"The correct option is
D: the price risk deriving from a small shift in the yield term structure.
Explanation:
Duration in bonds is used to measure the impact of interest rate risk. In other words, it measures the response of bond prices to the small shifts in the interest rates.  The volatility measures the percentage change in the prices of bonds when there is small change or shift in the yield term structure (YTM)
So, the duration captures the price risk deriving from a small shift in YTM.",Interest Rate Risk: The fluctuations of the interest rate in the market and its influence on the fixed- income securities or assets are known as interest rate risk. The buyer of the bonds expects an increase in the value of the asset by fall in prices.
17,Forging long term relations with customers can decrease interest rate risk.,True,False,,,B,"The answer is ""False."" Forging long-term relations with customers decreases credit risk because it can reduce the possibility that a customer will default on a loan in the future. This is because customers that have developed a relationship with their bank or loan provider may feel personally obligated to pay back the money they owe and will work harder to do so. Now, this is just a theoretical scenario and is not always the case.
The answer is False, because the question asks about interest rate risk, which is the risk that interest rates may change. This rarely is related to any personal relationship between a borrower and loan provider and is more dependent on the overall economy.","Interest Rates: Interest rates are the price paid for lending money to financial institutions in such a way that the interest payments are related to the rate at which interest is earned. In general, if interest rates rise, it means lenders will demand more from borrowers who want to borrow money. Conversely, if interest rates fall, it means lenders will be willing to make loans for less than borrowers were previously charging. Interest rates are particularly important because they provide an important measure of how much returns on each financial asset (such as stocks or bonds) fluctuate from day-to-day and year-to-year."
18,Which has a longer Macaulay's duration:,"a $1 million face value zero coupon bond with a two-year maturity and a yield of 6 percent, or",a $1 million face value coupon bond with a two-year maturity that pays 6 percent coupon interest?,,,A,"The answer is:
A. a $1 million face value zero coupon bond with a two-year maturity and a yield of 6 percent.
A zero-coupon bond is a bond that does not generate interest payments over its lifetime. Because of that, the zero-coupon bond has a Macaulay's duration equal to its time to maturity. Note that duration is the time until an investor receives back the money initially invested. So, the holder of a zero-coupon bond will recoup the investment when the bond matures because, at that date, the investor receives the first and only payment from the bond.
The duration of a coupon bond will always be less than the time until maturity. This is because coupon bonds pay interest at equal intervals (for example, every year), so the initial investment is recovered before maturity.
As both bonds in the given question have 2 years to maturity, the duration of the zero-coupon bond will be 2 years and that of the coupon bond will be less than 2 years. Hence, the zero-coupon bond has the longer Macaulay's duration.",Macaulay's Duration: The Macaulay's duration is the weighted average time a bondholder must wait until the present value of the payments received equals the amount initially invested. This measure is widely used by investors to estimate and assess the interest rate risk associated with a particular bond.
19,Purchasing long-term bonds reduce an investor's interest rate risk. True or False?,True,False,,,B,"The above statement is false.
Purchasing a long term bonds increases the interest rate risk of the investor because in long term bonds, the time to maturity is a long term period. So the interest rates on those bonds would fluctuate more and thus increases the interest rate risk. Longer the time duration, higher will be the interest rate risk.",Interest rate risk Interest rate risk refers to the risk associated with interest rate differential that arises for bondholders and other investment holders. The interest rate is inversely proportional to bond price. Investors always try to reduce the interest rate risk.
20,Which one of the following bonds has the longest duration (and thus the highest interest rate risk and the lowest re-investment risk)?,"zero coupon, 10 year maturity","zero coupon, 13 year maturity","8 percent coupon, 10 year maturity","8 percent coupon, 13 year maturity",B,"The correct answer is
b. zero coupon, 13 year maturity.
In general, the further away the payments of a bond are, the lower its reinvestment risk because the bond's yield is guaranteed to remain unchanged until maturity. Higher coupons and shorter maturity increase reinvestment risk because the cash received from the bond has to be reinvested when it is received.
The opposite relationship holds for interest rate risk. The lower the coupon payments and the longer the maturity of a bond, the higher its interest rate risk. This is so because payments received further into the future are more sensitive to changes in interest rates.
We can also see that b. is the correct answer if we look at the bond's duration formula.  The bond's duration directly measures the interest rate risk of a bond. The formula is:
{eq}Macaulay \ duration = \dfrac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}t*PV_{t}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}PV_{t}}

{/eq}, where
PV
t
= present value of bond cash flows in year t
n = number of years
As the bond maturity increases, the bond duration goes up because the numerator increases faster with t than the denominator.  Also, the bond duration is higher when the bond makes only one payment at maturity because the present value of that payment is the lowest.",Interest Rate Risk and Reinvestment Risk: This is the probability that the value of a bond will change as a result of changing interest rates.  Reinvestment risk is the probability that the expected return will change when the proceeds from a previous investment are used to make a new investment.
21,"Bonds with similar coupons will always have the same percentage price change, no matter the maturity. True or False?",True,False,,,B,"This statement is False.
Price risk, or interest rate risk, is measured as the percentage price change for a one percent change in interest rates.  This percentage price change depends on the coupon rate, but also depends on the time to maturity.  A higher time to maturity increases the price risk of a bond.
To see this, consider the following two bonds.  Bond A has 30 years to maturity and bond B matures today.  If interest rates increase by 1%, the price of the 30-year bond will decrease because its par value and all of its coupon payments will be discounted at a higher interest rate.  The price of Bond B will not change because its par value is expected to be received today and its present value does not depend ton the discount rate.  Thus, the percentage change of the price of bond A will be much higher than that of bond B.",Bond Price Changes: The price of a bond is the present value of its cash flows.  Bond prices can change for two reasons.  The first is a change in the interest rate of the bond.  This may occur when market interest rates change or when the bond's default risk changes.  The second reason is changes in the bond's cash flows.  This occurs naturally as the bond approaches its maturity over time.
22,The duration of a bond normally increases with an increase in:,term-to-maturity.,yield-to-maturity.,coupon rate.,all of the above,A,"The duration of a bond normally increases with an increase in:
a. term-to-maturity.

Let's see the effect of the other two factors:
b. yield-to-maturity. - The yield to maturity provides inconclusive results about change in duration and it can either increase or decrease.
c. coupon rate. - The coupon rate increase would decrease the duration as it will shift the fulcrum away from the maturity.","Bond Duration: The bond duration is the point in the timeline of the bond where the fulcrum of the bond's cash flows lies. It is the weighted average point in the bond maturity where all cash flows lie. This is, therefore, a measure of the interest rate risk."
23,Which one of the following bonds is the most sensitive to changes in market interest rates?,"Zero coupon, 25 year","10% annual coupon, 3 year","Zero coupon, 15 year","5% annual coupon, 10 year",A,"The answer is A.
A bond that has the longest duration is the most sensitive to changes in market interest rate. The duration of a bond is related to coupon rate and term to maturity as follows:
All else the same, the longer the term to maturity, the longer the duration
All else the same, the smaller the coupon rate, the longer the duration
The bond in option A has the smallest coupon rate and the longest term to maturity, thus also has the longest duration. Hence, this bond is the most sensitive to interest rate changes.","Bond Interest Risk: The interest rate risk of a bond is refers to the fluctuation in bond price that is drive by unexpected changes in interest rates.

24,Purchasing long-term bonds reduce an investor's interest rate risk. True or False?,True,False,,,B,"The above statement is false.
Purchasing a long term bonds increases the interest rate risk of the investor because in long term bonds, the time to maturity is a long term period.

25,The duration of a bond is a function of the bond's:,coupon rate.,yield to maturity.,time to maturity.,All of these are correct.,D,"The answer is D.
The duration of a bond depends on its coupon rate and yield to maturity. The present value of cash flows depends on the yield to maturity (i.e., discount rate) and coupon rate (which determines the amount of cash flows).
A bond's Macaulay Duration is the present value weighted time to maturity. Duration is the average of the time to maturity of cash flows weighted by the present value of the cash payments received at different points in time. So, the duration depends on the time to maturity.",Bond Duration: A bond's interest rate risk is positively correlated with the bond's duration. The bond duration measures the interest rate risk. A bond's interest rate risk arises due to uncertainty caused by the fluctuations in the bond price when the market interest rates change.

27,The interest rate risk of a noncallable bond is most likely to be positively related to the,Risk-free rate,Bond's coupon rate,Bond's time to maturity,Bond's yield to maturity,C,"The interest rate risk of a noncallable bond is most likely to be positively related to the
c. Bond's time to maturity
The higher the time to maturity, the greater the chance of the bond decreasing in price due to changes. Moreover, small changes would lead to a greater change in price if the maturity is longer. Also, the longer the time to maturity, the longer would be the duration of the bond.
Let's analyze other options:
a. Risk-free rate - If risk-free rise, the yield would rise and at higher yields, interest rate risk decreases.
b. Bond's coupon rate - A higher coupon would cushion the change in bond price and hence increase in coupon would decrease the risk.
d. Bond's yield to maturity - Increase in yield would lead to less sensitivity to change in prices.","Interest Rate Risk: A simple definition of the interest rate risk is the risk of unfavorable returns from the bond over the course of time.

Interest-rate risk can best be characterized as the risk that fluctuations in the price of a financial asset in response to changes in market interest rates. An interest rate risk refers to the likelihood of incurring investment losses due to changes in interest rates. Often, it arises for bond owners, and the amount of interest rate risk a bond bears depends on the sensitivity of its cost to market adjustments in interest rates. The sensitivity relies on the bond's coupon rate and maturity of the bond.

Which of the following bonds would have the largest percentage increase in price?,A 10-year bond with a 10 percent coupon.,An 8-year bond with a 9 percent coupon.,A 10-year zero coupon bond.,A 1-year bond with a 15 percent coupon.,C,"The answer is C).
For the same change in interest rate, the longer a bond's duration, the higher the percentage change in price. All else the same, a bond's duration is longer if (1) the year to maturity is longer; (2) the coupon rate is lower.  Option c) represents a bond with the longest year to maturity and the lowest coupon rate, among the bonds in the answer, thus the bond in C) has the longest duration and the largest increase in price.","Bond Duration: The duration of a bond is a measure of the bond's interest rate risk. The longer a bond's duration, the more sensitive the bond's price is with respect to changes in interest rate."
31,Discuss how each of the following theories for the term structure of interest rates could account for a downward-sloping term structure of interest rates.,Pure expectations,Liquidity preference,Market segmentation,,A,"a.	Pure expectations theory is based on the kind of interest rates that varies over time-time. In this theory, the investors predict the future interest rates and accordingly invest in such bonds at present. The reason for the downward sloping in this theory is when there's an increase in short-term interest rates.
b.	Liquidity preference theory depends on the demand of customers. There's an inverse relationship between the demand and interest rates. The curve in this theory is downward sloping due to high-interest rates.
c.	This theory is different from the above two that have to deal with the type of bonds and interest rates. The curve in this theory depends on the maturity length of bonds, i.e., either short-term or long-term. If the interest rates for short-term bonds are higher than the long-term bonds, the curve will be downward sloping.","Interest rates: The rate applied to the financial instruments or loans taken by the company, which is an additional sum to be paid with the principal amount, is referred to as the interest rate. These rates are affected by different situations like market conditions, change in exchange rate currency, etc."
32,Identify the bond that has the longest duration (no calculations necessary).,20-year maturity with an 8% coupon,20-year maturity with a 12% coupon,15-year maturity with a 0% coupon,10-year maturity with a 15% coupon,A,"The answer is
a. 20-year bond with an 8% coupon
.
In general, given the same coupon rate, the bond with a longer time to maturity will have a longer duration. Given the time to maturity, the bond with a lower coupon rate will have a longer duration. Since bond a) has a longer time to maturity but a lower coupon rate, it also has the highest duration.","Bond Duration: The duration of a bond is a measure of the bond's interest rate risk.

33,"If the Fed increases interest rates, the SML will shift _____ and asset prices will _____.",down; rise.,down; fall.,up; rise.,up; fall.,D,"If the Fed increases interest rates, the SML will shift _____ and asset prices will _____.
d. up; fall.
The SML graph will shift upwards. This is because when the Fed increases the interest rates, the investment risk increases since the interest rate risk goes up, thus, forcing the graph to shift upward. On the other hand, when the interest rate decreases, the investment risk decreases, and the SML moves downwards. Asset prices will fall since the risk involved in the investments will lead to a reduction in demand, thus, forcing the asset owners to decrease their prices to attract buyers. Therefore, the correct answer is
option d.
Additional Information
Option a. down; rise
is incorrect since the SML will shift upwards, and the asset prices will fall.
Option b. down; fall
is wrong because the SML will not shift downward.
Option c. up; rise
is wrong since the asset prices will fall.","Security Market Line (SML): Security Market Line (SML) refers to a graph used to represent the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).

The lower value of the call option increases the value of the bond to the investor.",Interest Rate Volatility: The volatility of the interest rate is the change in the interest rates over a period of time. Higher volatility leads to greater risk because there is a greater chance of a decrease in the value of any investment.
35,Which statement is true and which one is false? Explain your answer.,Interest rate on a 20-year mortgage is higher than the interest rate on a 30-year mortgage.,Interest rate on credit card debt is higher than the interest rate on a mortgage.,Interest rate on a AAA corporate bond is lower than the interest rate on a BB corporate bond with the same maturity.,Interest rate on a AAA corporate bond with 1 year until maturity is necessarily higher than interest rate on a 10-year treasury bond.,A,"A)
False:
The given statement is incorrect as the interest rate on a long-term mortgage is typically higher than on a short-term mortgage. It is simply because a longer mortgage means more risk for the lender, so the lender will, in turn, charge more interest as a reward for that risk. So, the interest rate on a 20-year mortgage will be less than a 30-year mortgage.
B)
True:
A credit card debt has a higher interest rate than a mortgage or loan. It is because credit cards are mostly unsecured loans, i.e., they don't have collateral backing. Lack of collateral makes it riskier for the bank/ lender, making it expensive.
C)
True:
AAA and BBB denote the rating of a bond. AAA bonds have the lowest risk for the investor and are an investment-grade bond. On the other hand, BBB bonds have medium risk. Since the risk is lower for AAA bonds, the borrower will pay less interest.
D)
False:
Interest rate on AAA corporate bonds is not higher than on a 10-year treasury bond. Since the treasury bond is for a longer duration, the rate of interest will also be greater. AAA corporate bonds have minimum risk involved. Hence their rate of interest is also lower.",Interest rate Interest rate is the proportion of principal or the total amount charged to the borrower by the lender.

According to the pure expectations theory, investors do not demand any risk premium for holding long term securities.  Thus, if a long term bond has a higher return than short term bonds, the only possible reason is that investors expect future interest rates to increase.  There is no assumption in this theory that future interest rates will remain the same.","Pure Expectations Theory: Pure expectations theory, also known as unbiased expectations theory, is a theory of interest rates.

47,Which of the following bonds has the most interest rate risk?,A 5-year bond with a 9 percent annual coupon.,A 5-year bond with a zero-coupon.,A 10-year bond with a 9 percent annual coupon.,A 10-year bond with a zero-coupon.,D,"The answer is d. A 10-year bond with a zero-coupon.
Interest rate risk refers to the variability of bond prices as a result of changes in interest rates.  In general interest rate risk increases with the bond's time to maturity and decreases with its coupon rate.
The longer the time to maturity, the more sensitive the bond price is to interest rate changes.  This is so because the cash flows of a long-term bond are discounted for a longer period of time, so small changes in the discount rate will result in large changes in the present value of the bond's cash flows.  To see this, consider an extreme example, in which a bond matures today.  Any changes in the market interest rate will have no effect on the price of this bond because the present value of the bond's only payment will be equal to the payment itself.
Similarly, the higher the coupon rate, the lower the sensitivity of the bond's price to interest rate changes.  This is so because when the coupon rate is higher, a larger fraction of the bond's payments will be received earlier.   As we discussed above, the sooner the bond's payments are received, the lower the interest rate risk.
a. is incorrect because the bond in a. has a shorter maturity and higher coupon rate.
b. is incorrect because the bond in b. has a shorter maturity and the same coupon rate.
c. is incorrect because the bond in c. has the same maturity and higher coupon rate.","Bond Risk: There are different types pf bond risk.
