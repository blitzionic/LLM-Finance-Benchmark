1,"A 25-year bond with a par value of $1,000 sells for $990.92. The current market interest rate is 10%. How much coupon interest does the bond pay?",$119.34 ,$98.99 ,$247.45 ,$100.00 ,B,"The correct answer is Option
(B)
i.e.,
$98.99
.
Given Information
Par value, FV =$1,000
Current price, CP = $990.92
Interest rate, r = 10%
Time to maturity = 25 years
Let C be the coupon payment.
Computation of coupon interest payment
{eq}\begin{align*}

CP &= \left[ {C \times \left( {\dfrac{{1 - {{\left( {1 + r} \right)}^{ - n}}}}{r}} \right)} \right] + \dfrac{{FV}}{{{{\left( {1 + r} \right)}^n}}}\\

\$ 990.92 &= \left[ {C \times \left( {\dfrac{{1 - {{\left( {1 + 10\% } \right)}^{ - 25}}}}{{10\% }}} \right)} \right] + \dfrac{{\$ 1,000}}{{{{\left( {1 + 10\% } \right)}^{25}}}}\\

\$ 990.92 &= \left[ {C \times \dfrac{{0.9077}}{{0.10}}} \right] + \dfrac{{\$ 1,000}}{{10.8347}}\\

\$ 990.92 &= 9.077 \times C + \$ 92.30\\

C &= \dfrac{{\left( {\$ 990.92 - \$ 92.30} \right)}}{{9.077}}\\

&= \$ 98.99

So, the correct answer is
option d) 8.675%
Explanation
Present value of bond = Semi-annual interest * PVIFA (semi-annual rate, period) + Maturity value * PVIF (semi-annual rate, period)
Here,
Present value of bond = $1,107.20
Semi-annual rate = 3.875% (7.75%/2)
Period = 60 semi-annual years (30 * 2)
Maturity value = $1,000
Semi-annual interest = Face value * Coupon rate
So,
$1,107.20 = Semi-annual interest * PVIFA (3.875%, 60) + $1,000 * PVIF (3.875%, 60)
$1,107.20 = Semi-annual interest * PVIFA (3.875%, 60) + $1,000 * PVIF (3.875%, 60)
$1,107.20 = $1,000 * Coupon rate * 23.169719 + $1,000 * 0.102173
$1,107.20 = Coupon rate * 23,169.72 + $102.17
