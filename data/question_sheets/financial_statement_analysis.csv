1,Another term for horizontal analysis is:,industrial analysis.,financial analysis.,trend analysis.,common size analysis.,C,"Answer: c. trend analysis.
The trend analysis is another term used for horizontal analysis. This is a financial statement analysis which compares financial and financial position over a period of time. It uses a base period, otherwise known as base year, to know the percentage and amount of changes of each of the accounts in the balance sheet and income statement.",Financial Statements: Financial statements shows the financial state of the business. These are prepared and submitted to the oversight agencies for regulatory purposes.
2,Which of the following is not a tool or technique used by a financial statement analyst?,Random sampling analysis.,Trend analysis.,Common-size financial statements.,Industry comparisons.,A,"The correct option is A. Random sampling analysis.
The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
A. Random sampling analysis.
This is the correct alternative because random sampling analysis is a tool used for auditing not in financial statements analysis
.
B. Trend analysis.
This is a common form of financial statements analysis where the change over time of important financial statements items like sales revenue and total assets is expressed as a percentage.
C. Common-size financial statements.
This is also a form of financial statements analysis. It includes vertical and horizontal analyses.
D. Industry comparisons.
This is another form of financial statements analysis where common ratios such as gross profit and net income margin are compared to industry benchmarks.",Financial Statement Analysis: Financial statements analysis refers to the applications of various tools and formulas to a set of financial statements to evaluate a company's performance and its financial position. External users such as investors and bankers as well as internal users such as the audit committee and the board of directors use financial statements analysis.
3,The gross profit percentage decreased from 36.5% in 2014 to 24.8% in 2015. What is the trend in this change?,The answer depends upon whether net sales increased or decreased during the period.,The trend cannot be determined unless the dollar amount of the change is also know.,"This change represents an upward, or favorable, trend.","This change represents a downward, or negative, trend.",D,"The answer is
option d. "" This change represents a downward, or negative, trend.""
Based on the trend analysis, the gross percentage in 2015 of 24.8% is lower than in 2014 of 36.5%. This means the company has an unfavorable result since the trend is downward, not upward. Options a, b, and c are incorrect. The cost of sales data also impacts gross profit, not only net sales. The trend can be determined since the gross profit percentages change are given. The movement is not upward since it did not increase. Thus, option d is correct.","Trend Analysis: Trend and horizontal analysis are the same because it compares the previous data with the current data, which could be a change in amount or percentage. It helps analysts determine if the company's performance is improving or deteriorating."
4,Which type of analysis could reveal that a company is relying heavily on debt financing?,Common size statements.,Horizontal analysis.,The fixed asset turnover ratio.,Trend analysis.,A,"The appropriate analysis is vertical to determine if the company has heavy debts since it converts all the items into percent of the base account.
Option A. Common size statement is another term for vertical analysis, in which the financial statements amounts are in percent. So, it could identify how large the debt was compared to the total assets. So, it is the correct answer.
Option B. Horizontal analysis is incorrect since it compares the previous year's debt to the current or its trend, not how large it is.
Option C. The fixed asset turnover relates to how efficiently the company uses fixed assets to generate revenue. So, it is incorrect.
Option D. Trend analysis is the same as option B.
Hence, the answer is A.","Financial Statement Analysis: The financial statement analysis is prepared to evaluate the organization's profitability, efficiency, liquidity, solvency, and others to check if it is worth investing in."
5,Trend analysis:,identifies changes over time.,focus on important relationships within financial statements.,presents each asset as a percentage of net sales.,presents each liability as a percentage of total liabilities.,A,"Answer: a. identifies changes over time.
Trend Analysis is also known as the horizontal analysis. This shows the amount and percentage changes overtime by comparing the current period against the base period. The percentage and amount are also interpreted as increases or decreases and is helpful in decision making. Choices B, C and D pertain to vertical analysis.","Vertical Analysis: In a balance sheet, vertical analysis shows the percentage of each of the accounts as a percentage of total assets. In the income statement, the accounts are presented as a percentage of the total sales."
6,Vertical analysis consists of a study of a single financial statement in which each item is expressed as a percentage of a significant total.,True,False,,,A,"The correct answer is option a. True.
Vertical analysis analyzes financial statements where each item is expressed as a percentage of a significant total, usually the total assets or total revenue. This technique allows for easier comparison between different periods or different companies, as it focuses on the relative proportion of each item rather than the absolute values. So, the above statement is
true.","Financial Statements: Businesses can spot patterns in their financial performance and position by examining their financial accounts over time. Making choices about upcoming investments, growth initiatives, and strategic direction can be based on the information provided on the said financial statements."
7,The time's interest earned ratio measures a company's ability to:,maintain profit after paying interest.,pay interest and debt on the due date.,make interest payments out of current earnings.,pay interest and debt from current assets already on hand.,C,"The correct option is
(c) make interest payments out of current earnings.
{eq}\text{Times Interest Earned Ratio} = \dfrac{\text{Earnings before interest and taxes}}{\text{Interest Expenses}}

{/eq}
The times' interest earned ratio is also called the
interest coverage ratio
as it shows the company's ability to pay off its interest from its current earnings. The higher the times interest earned ratio, the higher the capacity of the company to pay its interest from its current earnings.","Ratio Analysis: Absolute figures do not provide a great base to compare a company's performance as different companies can have different market exposure, different paid-in capital, different working capital, etc. Therefore analysts use ratios to compare the companies."
8,Horizontal analysis is:,looking at the changes in the account balances reported on a financial statement over time.,looking at the changes in the account balances within a financial statement for one year.,preparing an analysis of the profitability ratios in columns.,looking at the changes in the account balances within a financial statement for three years.,A,"The answer is
option A.
The horizontal analysis calculates the changes in dollars and percentages of each item in the financial statements over time, like comparing the current and previous year or any two or more periods, to determine if there is an increase or decrease or if it has improved or not. So, option A is correct.
Analysis of other options
B. Changes within a year are not horizontal analyses, which need at least two or more periods.
C. Profitability ratios are part of the ratio analysis, not horizontal analysis.
D. Horizontal analysis is done over two or more periods, not fixed at three years.","Financial Statement Analysis: Financial statement analysis has three approaches: horizontal, vertical, or ratio, depending on the needed information of the evaluator from the financial statement of the firm."
9,A technique for evaluating a series of financial statement data over a period of time is called:,horizontal analysis,vertical analysis,ratio analysis,None of these answer choices are correct.,A,"The correct answer is option a. horizontal analysis.
Horizontal analysis is a technique for evaluating a series of financial statement data over a period of time. It involves comparing financial data from different periods to identify trends, growth, or declines in a company's performance. This analysis helps users to understand the changes in the financial health of the company and make informed decisions.
Accordingly, the correct answer is option
a. horizontal analysis.
Incorrect Options
b. Vertical analysis: Vertical analysis is a financial statement analysis technique in which each statement line item is expressed as a percentage of a base figure (such as total assets, total equity, or total revenue). This method is sometimes called common-size analysis.
c. Ratio analysis: Ratio analysis is a technique used to evaluate a company's financial performance by analyzing various financial ratios. These ratios are calculated using data from the financial statements and help assess profitability, liquidity, solvency, efficiency, and valuation.
d. None of these answer choices are correct.

b. financial statement data for the same year is compared to different accounts.
Vertical analysis is a comparative analysis technique usually used for financial statements like the balance sheet and income statement. Under this kind of analysis, every account on the financial statement of a given year is expressed as a percentage of assets or income value. In other words, we are comparing the data of different accounts in the same year for a given financial statement.
Horizontal analysis is a trend analysis technique whereby the same account of a financial statement is compared for different years.","Comparative Analysis: In accounting, the comparative analysis techniques like vertical analysis and horizontal analysis are used for financial statements like the balance sheet and income statement. These techniques help in getting a relative idea for various accounts."
11,Horizontal analysis is analysis,of dollar changes and percentage changes over two or more years.,in which all items are presented as a percentage of one selected item on a financial statement.,in which a statistic is calculated for the relationship between two items on a single financial statement or for two items on different financial statements,of all ratios that increased or decreased over past accounting periods.,A,"The answer is

13,Trend analysis is a form of horizontal analysis that can reveal patterns in data across successive periods.,True,False,,,A,"The answer is
true.
Trend analysis is a type of horizontal analysis since it calculates the percentages of each item in the financial statements by comparing its current year's amount to the base year's amount. So, it considers the data from other periods to show the pattern of the account. Depending on the result, it is either increasing, decreasing, improving, or deteriorating. It helps the company determine the items that need to be focused on or have problems that need to be addressed.","Financial Statement Analysis: There are three types of financial statement analysis, which depend on what data the company needs. These are horizontal, vertical, and ratio analyses."
14,Horizontal analysis is also known as:,trend analysis.,vertical analysis.,ratio analysis.,common-size analysis.,A,"The correct option is
Option a: Trend analysis
.
Option a: Horizontal analysis is commonly called base-year and trend analysis. It is centered on historical data that evaluates an entity's financial statements by taking two or more fiscal years and interpreting the trend of every item stated in such statements. The trends are computed by contrasting the present values with base year values. Thus, this option is accurate.
Option b: Vertical analysis provides the proportional analysis of formulated financial statements in which every item specified in those statements is presented as a percentage of a particular base figure taken from the financial statements. This point is not relevant for horizontal analysis. Thus, this point is incorrect.
Option c: Ratio analysis is executed to check the operational efficiencies, liquidity, and profitability of an entity by examining its financial statements. This analysis is not similar to horizontal analysis. Thus, this option is also inaccurate.
Option d: Vertical analysis and common-size analysis are identical analyses. These are often used to evaluate financial strength by comparing data from certain periods. Thus, this option is also inaccurate.","Financial Reporting: Financial reporting comprises delivering relevant information about the financial activities of the entity in a structured format, i.e., financial statements. These reports assist the finance department in evaluating the cash flow risks."
15,Mussa Corporation reports the following data:,33%.,200%.,50%.,67%.,D,"The correct option is

{eq}\begin{align} \text{Cost of Goods Sold Percentage} &= \dfrac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Net Sales}} \times 100\\ &= \dfrac{\$180,000}{\$270,000} \times 100\\ &= 67\%\\ \end{align} {/eq}","Vertical Analysis: In vertical analysis, the percentage of different line items of the income statement is calculated with net sales as the base. It only considers the current period figures in the analysis."
16,"Assume that the accounts receivable balances are $110,000, $112,000, and $116,000 for 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. The trend percentage for 2023 is:",3.6%.,5.5%.,103.6%.,105.5%.,A,"The correct option is
d, i.e., 105.5%
.
Computation of the trend percentage for 2023-
The accounts receivable balance in 2021 is considered the base year, so the trend percentage is computed by dividing the accounts receivable balance in 2023 by the base year, i.e., accounts receivable balance in 2021, and multiplying the derived value by 100.
Particulars
Amount
Accounts receivable balance in 2021 (a)
$110,000
Accounts receivable balance in 2023 (b)
$116,000

17,Which of the following statements is false about vertical analysis?,It is useful for analyzing changes in financial statements over time.,Each line item is expressed as a percentage of some total or key amount within the same statement.,The dollar amount of change in each line item is calculated.,It is useful for analyzing relationships within a financial statement.,C,"The correct answer is
c. The dollar amount of change in each line item is calculated.
This statement is false because, in vertical analysis, each line item is converted into a percentage using a metric from the financial statement as the base item. It is under horizontal analysis that the dollar amount of change in each line item over the years is calculated.
The other options state features that are true of vertical analysis.
a.
It is useful for analyzing changes in financial statements over time:
The change in the percentage of line items with respect to base items helps in analyzing the change in the structure of financial statements. This is done when comparing a current statement's percentage of line items with that of a past statement where a vertical analysis has been employed.
b.
Each line item is expressed as a percentage of some total or key amount within the same statement:
The base item that is used to convert all items into percentages is a key amount within the financial statements and is used as the key factor to derive the information in the vertical analysis. For example, revenue is the base item for the income statement, and total assets are the base item for the balance sheet.
d.
It is useful for analyzing relationships within a financial statement:
When each line item is expressed in terms of a base item, it helps in understanding the composition of the financial statement and the relationship between different line items that make up the statement.",Financial Statement Analysis: The process of analyzing the information contained within the financial statements of a company is called financial statement analysis. It provides useful information to the stakeholders and the managers of the company which they use for decision-making.
18,The common size income statement shows each income statement item as a percentage of:,gross income.,net income.,gross sales.,net sales.,C,"Answer: c. gross sales.
A common size financial statement analysis is also known as the vertical analysis. This computes for the percentage of each of the accounts in the income statement as a percentage of the gross sales and in the balance sheet as a percentage of the total assets. All other line items in the balance sheet and income statement are divided to the total assets and gross sales, respectively, to compute the percentages.","Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is also known as the Statement of Financial Position.

21,Return on assets:,is calculated as net income/average total assets.,is calculated as the average total assets/net income.,is calculated as net income/net sales.,measures the amount of sales dollars generated by each dollar of assets invested in the business.,A,"The correct option is
A. is calculated as net income/average total assets.
Return on assets is the ratio between the net income of the business and the average assets of the business. It shows the income generated during the period for every dollar invested in the business's total assets. It is used to compare the performance of different businesses. It can be calculated by the below formula.
{eq}\text{Return on Assets} = \dfrac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Total Assets}} {/eq}
Explanation for incorrect options
B. is calculated as the average total assets/net income. - It is the reverse of return on assets.
C. is calculated as net income/net sales. - It is the formula of net margin, hence option (C) is incorrect.
D. measures the amount of sales dollars generated by each dollar of assets invested in the business. - It is the description of the turnover ratio, hence option (D) is incorrect.","Ratio Analysis: Ratio Analysis studies the relationship between different line items of the business's financial statements.

Cash
$50
Inventories
$400
Total Current Assets
$450
The total current assets are worth $450. The total current liabilities are equivalent to the total value of accounts payable as it is the only item classified as current liability. So, given available data, the total net working capital is equivalent to the following.
Net Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current Liabilities
Net Working Capital = $450 - $315
Net Working Capital = $135
Therefore, the correct answer is
option b. 135.","Financial Statement Analysis: In accounting, financial statement analysis is valuable in making significant business decisions. It helps in evaluating business proposals, projects, etc."
23,Analytical procedures would consist of all of the following except:,Cross-wire horizontal financial analysis.,Leverage ratios.,Liquidity ratios.,,B,"The correct option is
a, i.e., Crosswire horizontal financial analysis
.
Explanation
Cross-sectional analysis is used by analysts to find unique traits within a set of comparable organizations. It seeks to uncover measures outside the usual ratios to give unique insights into that sector.   It is used by the stakeholders to compare the company's performance within the industry but does not act as an analytic procedure to increase the company's efficiency.
The explanation for incorrect options-
Option b: Firms rely on a combination of stock and debt to fund their operations; so, the leverage ratio is critical. It is useful in analyzing if a corporation can pay off its due commitments to determine how much debt it carries.
Option c: Liquidity ratio determines a company's ability to turn its short-term assets into cash shortly within a year. It is an analytical procedure that represents the company's solvency.","Ratio Analysis- Ratio analysis uses the company's financial statement components to derive the company's efficiency analysis. It provides insights into findings in terms of percentage, turnover, and ratios."
24,Liquidity ratios measure the ability of an entity to:,survive in the long-term,meet its short-term obligations and unexpected cash needs,generate profit,All of the options are correct.,B,"The correct answer is
option b) to meet its short-term obligations and unexpected cash needs.
This is because liquidity ratios are the ratios that take into account key inputs like cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities for the computations. Liquidity ratios show the company's ability to meet its obligations in the short term by evaluating its current assets and liabilities.
Other options are incorrect.
Option a) survive in the long term
: This is incorrect because the liquidity ratio's output is only limited to a year or to an operating cycle for the inferences. It is not applicable in the long term.
Option c) generate profit
: This is incorrect because it is the profitability ratio that measures the ability of an entity to generate profit, not the liquidity ratio.
Option d): All of the options are correct
: This is incorrect because options a and c are indications of the other ratios; they are not relevant to the liquidity ratio.","Ratio Analysis: Ratio analysis refers to the evaluation of a company's financial outlook using various financial ratios. It uses the financials of the company as input and computes metrics, which gives an insight into the financial health and stability of the company."
25,The percentage analysis of accounts payable to total liabilities is an example of _____.,liquidity analysis,current position analysis,vertical analysis,component analysis,C,"The percentage analysis of accounts payable to total liabilities is an example of
vertical analysis.
Vertical analysis is a technique in financial analysis where all the items in a financial statement are represented as a percentage of a base item within the same statement. In this case, the base item is total liabilities, and accounts payable are analyzed as a percentage of total liabilities. It helps in understanding the relative importance of accounts payable concerning the total liabilities of the company and how it affects the company's financial position.
Therefore,
the correct answer is option C. vertical analysis.","Financial Statement Analysis: Financial statement analysis is a tool used in management accounting to aid investors' decision-making process. By examining its financial records, investors can determine if a firm is financially sound and has room for expansion."
26,Vertical analysis would rarely be performed on which of the following?,balance sheets,Income statements,Schedule of depreciation,all of the above are common target of vertical analysis,C,"The correct answer is
option c) schedule of depreciation.
The schedule of depreciation is the structure of depreciation that lays out the series of projected depreciation expenses and the balance value of assets. It helps an entity track expenses and the decrease in the value of an asset over its useful life. The application of vertical analysis to the schedule of depreciation is illogical and does not produce any outcome that can be interpreted to infer any financial decision.
Other options are incorrect.
Option a) balance sheets
: This is incorrect because the vertical analysis is widely used to analyze balance sheets by taking total assets as the base amount and expressing line items as percentages of total assets.
Option b) Income statements
: This is incorrect because the vertical analysis can be applied to an income statement by taking total revenue as the base amount and expressing line items as proportions.
Option d) All of the above are common targets of vertical analysis
: This is incorrect because only income statements and balance sheets are relevant for the application of vertical analysis to infer a logical outcome.",Vertical Analysis: Vertical analysis refers to the method used to analyze the financial statements of a company. It presents each line item of the statements as a percentage of the base amount. This helps an analyst identify the relative proportion of each line item to the base amount.
27,A technique for evaluating financial statement data that expresses each item in a financial statement as a percentage of a base amount is called:,horizontal analysis,vertical analysis,ratio analysis,None of these answer choices are correct.,B,"The correct answer is
option b. vertical analysis.
Vertical analysis is a method that computes the line items as a percentage of the base amount of the financial statements. It helps the analyst identify how much weight the line items hold compared to the base amount.
Other options are incorrect.
Option a. horizontal analysis
: This is incorrect because horizontal analysis involves the comparative analysis of statements across periods. It does not express the line items as a percentage of the base amount.
Option c. ratio analysis
: This is incorrect because ratio analysis involves the usage of line items on an absolute basis as inputs for computing the various key metrics used in the analysis. It does not involve the use of proportional line items.
Option d. None of these answer choices are correct
: This is incorrect, as the given statement in answer option b matches the method of vertical analysis.","Financial Analysis: Financial analysis is a methodology that helps analysts and readers of financial statements evaluate, interpret, and assess the financial performance and position of a company. Analysts may use various methods in the process, such as horizontal analysis, vertical analysis, and ratio analysis."
28,Horizontal analysis is:,looking at the changes in the account balances reported on a financial statement over time.,looking at the changes in the account balances within a financial statement for one year.,preparing an analysis of the profitability ratios in columns.,looking at the changes in the account balances within a financial statement for three years.,A,"The answer is
option A.
The horizontal analysis calculates the changes in dollars and percentages of each item in the financial statements over time, like comparing the current and previous year or any two or more periods, to determine if there is an increase or decrease or if it has improved or not. So, option A is correct.
Analysis of other options
B. Changes within a year are not horizontal analyses, which need at least two or more periods.
C. Profitability ratios are part of the ratio analysis, not horizontal analysis.
D. Horizontal analysis is done over two or more periods, not fixed at three years.","Financial Statement Analysis: Financial statement analysis has three approaches: horizontal, vertical, or ratio, depending on the needed information of the evaluator from the financial statement of the firm."

a. Current year total assets amount.
This is the formula used to prepare the vertical analysis of the balance sheet.
b. Current year net income amount.
This is used in the vertical analysis of the income statement.
c. Current year stockholder's equity amount.
This is not used in any common-size analysis.
d. Base-year amount.
This is the correct alternative because, in horizontal analysis, two financial years are compared. This means that the current year amount for each line item is expressed as a percentage of the base-year amount to show the increase or decrease in the item in the current year.",Horizontal and Vertical Analyses: Horizontal and vertical analyses are two common-size financial analyses employed by the users of financial statements to interpret the current period results of a company and understand the changes in its financial position.
30,"In vertical analysis,",the same base is used across all financial statements analyzed.,a base amount is optional.,a base amount is required.,the results of the horizontal analysis are necessary inputs for performing the analysis.,C,"The answer is
option c.
In vertical analysis, all the items' amounts in the financial statements are converted into percent of the
base amount, so it is required.
In the income statement, the base is net sales, while the balance sheet is total assets.
Analysis of other options
A. As explained above, the base is different for every financial statement, not the same across all financial statements. Total assets for balance sheet and net income for income statement.
B. The base amount is not optional but a requirement.
D. The vertical analysis does not need the result of the horizontal analysis because it only depends on the data in the financial statements.","Vertical Analysis: The company uses vertical analysis to compare two companies: large and small, or from different industries.
