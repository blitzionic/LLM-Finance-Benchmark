{/eq}.",D,"The correct answer is option
d. 8.1
Explanation
{eq}Issue\ price * (1 + yield\ to\ maturity\ rate)^ {period} = Maturity\ value

{/eq}
Here,
Issue price = $459
Maturity value = $1,000
Period = 10
So,
{eq}$459 * (1 + yield\ to\ maturity\ rate)^ {10} = $1,000

{/eq}
{eq}(1 + yield\ to\ maturity\ rate) = ($1,000/$459)^ {1/10}

{/eq}
Yield to maturity = 1.08098267 - 1
Yield to maturity rate
=
0.8098 or 8.09%
This is closet to 8.1% so correct answer is option d",Zero Coupon Bond Zero coupon bond are non-interest bearing bonds. These bonds are issued by the borrower at a discounted rate and the face value is received by the lender at maturity. The difference between the issue price and the face value is the interest on the bond. The zero coupon bond are also known as deep discounted bond because these bonds are always issued at a discounted price

3,Which of the following would not be associated with a zero-coupon bond?,Yield to maturity,Interest-rate risk,Discount bond,Current yield,D,"The answer is D.
Since zero-coupon bond will not make any coupon payments, it is impossible to estimate the current yield in this case.","Zero-Coupon Bonds: Zero-coupon bonds are bonds that will not make any interest payments to investors. Instead, investors will receive the par value at the maturity and can purchase bonds at a deep discount price."
4,"Given its time to maturity, the duration of a zero-coupon bond is:",lowest when the discount rate is equal to the risk-free rate.,higher when the discount rate is higher.,higher when the discount rate is lower.,the same regardless of the discount rate.,D,"The correct answer is d.
In the case of a zero-coupon bond, the duration is equal to maturity. The duration of bonds is dependent on coupon payments, and since, the zero-coupon bond does not make any coupon payments, therefore, its duration is independent of the discount rate. Thus, we can conclude that the duration of a zero-coupon bond is the same and does not take into consideration the discount rate.","Zero-Coupon Bond: A zero-coupon bond is a debt instrument that does not carry an interest rate but can be traded at high discounts, thus, resulting in profits for the seller.

C
When the yield curve is flat, it shows the yield spread between the long-term bonds and the short-term bonds is falling. A flat curve states that the bonds with money to a loan will get the same amount of interest rate to loan their money via bonds for the short-term bonds. The flattening yield curve indicates recession and does not show that the flat curve yield will not have the same yield.

35,Zero-coupon bonds always sell at a discount.,True,False,,,A,"Answer: True
Zero Coupon Bonds is a liability account that does not pay interest and is issued at a discount. A zero coupon bond is treated the same as non-interest bearing note. The difference between the present value of the bonds and the face value is the discount.Because Zero Coupon Bonds does not bear interest, this discount is deemed as the interest on the notes and will be amortized over the life of the note.

38,"For long-term U.S. government bonds, which risk concerns investors the most?",Interest rate risk,Default risk,Market risk,Liquidity risk,A,"The answer is A. Interest rate risk.
The US government bonds are highly affected by interest rate risks. When investors are scared of inflation or when the financial markets hope for the Feds to increase the rates of interest, it is highly likely that the returns on government bonds would increase with a decrease in their prices. This causes a huge impact on the long-term bonds since their prices fall substantially compared to other short-term bonds. Generally, the interest rate risk refers to the possibility of a loss in government bonds due to the changes in the rates of interest. The bonds' value reduces with a rise in the rates of interest.","Government bonds: Purchasing government bonds means lending funds to the government, and in return being paid a certain interest level at stated periods.

:
A. Incorrect. There is no interest payment for a zero-coupon bond.

45,The current exchange rate between French franc and U.S. Dollar is FF 5.529 per dollar. Last month this rate was FF 5.491 per dollar.,FF has appreciated,US $ has depreciated,FF has depreciated,US $ has appreciated,C,"The correct answer is option
c) FF has depreciated
The current exchange rate between French Franc and US Dollar has increased to FF 5.529 per dollar compares to its last month's value of FF 5.491 per dollar.
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{Increase in exchange rate}}\, &= \,{\rm\text{Current exchange rate}}\, - \,{\rm\text{Last month's exchange rate}}\\

&= {\rm\text{FF}}\,5.529\,{\rm\text{per dollar}}\, - \,{\rm\text{FF}}\,5.491\,{\rm\text{per dollar}}\\

&= {\rm\text{FF}}\,0.038\,{\rm\text{per dollar}}

\end{align*}

{/eq}
It implies that an additional FF 0.038 must be paid to purchase one dollar. Since an additional amount is to be paid for buying the same volume of foreign currency (US Dollars), it implies that the FF value has decreased, which indicates a situation of FF depreciation. Hence,
option c is correct.
Incorrect option explanation:
If FF had appreciated, the current exchange rate would be less than last month's exchange rate as the FF is more valuable at present than last month. Hence,
option a is incorrect.
FF has been compared to one dollar in both cases. So, it means that the dollar value has not appreciated or depreciated. Hence,
options b and d are incorrect.","Currency Depreciation: When more money has to be paid to buy a product or currency, it implies that the domestic currency's value has declined. This situation is marked as currency depreciation and is unfavorable to the economy."

The answer is
A. The long-term bonds issued by the U.S. government are called Treasury Bills.
That statement is incorrect because Treasury bills are not long-term bonds. Treasury bills are
short-term securities
that typically mature within a year. They may mature in just a few days or 365 days.
The government issues securities as a means to raise funds. Among these, Treasury bills stand out as one of the safest investments. This is because the full faith and credit of the issuing government, in this case, the United States, backs them. The Department of the Treasury issues Treasury bills through regular auctions. Investors purchase these T-bills at a discount from their face value and receive the total face value when the T-bill matures. The difference between the purchase price and the face value is the investor's return.
The other given statements are true regarding bond trading and, therefore, are not the answer to the question.

The main difference between a regular bond and a zero-coupon bond is that a zero-coupon bond does not pay interest payments.
50,The book value of zero-coupon bonds increases by the periodic amount of interest recognized. True or false?,True,False,,,A,"It is
true
to say that the book value of zero-coupon bonds increases by the periodic amount of interest recognized because zero-coupon bonds are always issued at a discount because the present value of its future cash flows is always lower than the maturity value. When a discount on a bond issue is amortized, the carrying amount for the liability increases.
Let us illustrate this with an example. Let us say a company issued 5-year, $1,000,000 zero-coupon bonds for $747,258 when the market interest rate is 6%. The amortization schedule for the bonds looks like this:
