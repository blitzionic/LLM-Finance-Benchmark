2,Unsecured debt issued by bank holding companies is a form of equity capital.,True,False,,,A,"The above statement is True.
Funds invested in a company by investors in return for ordinary or preferred shares are known as equity capital. This is the foundational investment for a firm to which debt financing could be added.
In addition to receiving the principal amount, debt capital's lender also receives interest income. Those who own shares receive dividends or profits. Debt financing can be secured (against the surety of an asset) or unsecured. Since shareholders receive ownership rights, equity capital is insecure.
Similar to equity capital holders, these bank-holding corporations own a share of the commercial bank's voting stock, which enables them to vote on issues about the development of the bank's corporate policies. They exercise control over the bank but do not participate in its daily operations. Like equity shareholders, they make loans.","Unsecured Debt: Unsecured debt is any debt or general obligation not collateralized by a claim on particular assets of the borrower in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or inability to satisfy the terms of repayment. It is sometimes referred to as uninsured debt."
3,"A lender requires 2 points on a $250,000 loan with a 7% rate amortization over a 25 year-term, payable monthly. What is the effective yield to the lender if the loan runs full term?",9.0%,6.8%,7.2%,6.0%,C,"The answer is
C) 7.2%.
Given information:
Initial principal = $250,000

6,Sam received a $290 discount loan to purchase a stereo. The loan was offered at 16% for 90 days.,$279.4,$278.40,$277.40,,B,"Correct answer:
1. Option b. $11.60
2. Option b. $278.40
Given:
Loan value = $290
Annual interest rate = 16%
Loan period = 90 days
Number of days in a year = 360 days (approximately)
So, the interest would be:
1. Interest:
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{Interest}}\, &= \,{\rm\text{Loan value}}\, \times \,{\rm\text{Interest rate}}\, \times \dfrac{{{\rm\text{Loan period in days}}}}{{{\rm\text{Number of days in a year}}}}\\

Thus, the interest is
$11.60.
2. Proceeds:
The proceeds can be computed by reducing the interest of $11.60 from the loan value of $290.
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{Proceeds}}\, &= \,{\rm\text{Loan value}}\, - \,{\rm\text{Interest}}\\

7,Refinancing a loan for more money than was originally owed is called a(n):,add-on loan.,accelerated loan.,discount loan.,garnishment.,A,"The correct answer is A.
Refinancing a loan for more money in the process of adding more loan amounts at a cheaper interest rate than the first loan amount in which the interest rate is high. So, it is an add-on loan.
Reason for incorrect option:
Option B. accelerated loan refers to the borrower having to pay his entire loan amount immediately.
Option C. In a discount, the loan borrower gets a discount on the loan amount. And not refinance it.
Option D. A garnishment is the order to seize assets.","Loan: A loan is when a person obtains finance from any friend, bank, or financial entity with the binding that it will be returned in the future along with principal and interest."

C. $198
Before we prepare the loan amortization schedule, we will first calculate the monthly loan installments using the formula below
{eq}\rm Installment=\dfrac{\text{ Loan amount}}{\dfrac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}}

{/eq}
Where
r
is the loan interest rate per period and
n
is the number of periods. Therefore

10,Banks calculate the monthly payment on a loan as:,an ordinary annuity with payment made one month in advance.,an annuity due with payment made one month in advance.,an ordinary annuity with payment made at the end of the month.,an annuity due with payment made at the end of the month.,C,"The answer is
c. an ordinary annuity with payment made at the end of the month.
The series of monthly payments represents an annuity. Thus, if the monthly payment is required at the beginning of each month, it is an annuity due. Otherwise, it is an ordinary annuity. In practice, most banks will not require borrowers to make a payment immediately at the loan origination.","Installment Loan: An installment loan is a financing option in which a borrower can repay the loan with monthly payments. Usually, monthly payments are constant during the entire life of the loan. Within a monthly payment, there are two components: interest payment and principal repayment."
11,A loan discount is:,a loan used to purchase a bond at a discount.,a discount market interest rate on a loan.,the same as a bond discount.,None of the above.,D,"The correct option is
option D. None of the above.
Option A: Loan Discount states the interest amount which is deducted from the loan principal value when the loan is acquired at a discount. A bond discount presents a bond type that can be purchased for less than its par or face value. Thus, loan discounts are not linked with bonds, as bonds are debt instruments traded in the money market.
Option B: A loan discount is a loan type for which interest and other charges are not required to be paid. Thus, the interest rate is not discounted in the loan.
Option C: A bond discount implies that the bond's market price is lower than its par value, whereas a loan discount means an amount that is already reduced by interest and other related charges. These two terms have different parameters.
The given statements related to loan discounts are false as a loan discount involves payment of that borrowed amount, which excludes interest and other related charges. Therefore, the correct option is
option D

13,Each payment on a mortgage note payable consists of,interest on the original balance of the loan only.,reduction of loan principal only.,interest on the original balance of the loan and reduction of loan principal.,interest on the unpaid balance of the loan and reduction of loan principal.,D,"The correct answer is Option D.
The payment made for the mortgage note payable remains the same for every period. However, the proportion of interest and principal repayment changes every time. Initially, the installment amount consists of greater interest expense and lesser principal repayment. This interest expense keeps declining with every installment because the interest expense is calculated on the loan balance that is yet to be paid.
Explanation for Incorrect Options:
Option A: The installment/payment amount consists of principal repayment also. Thus, this option is incorrect.
Option B: This is not correct because each payment on the bond payable includes the interest amount.
Option C: The interest is not paid on the original balance. Rather, it is paid on the carrying value of the mortgage.",Loan: The amount borrowed to finance an entity's assets is termed a loan. There are different types of a loan based on their tenure or purpose. It is commonly classified as a short-term and long-term loan.

B. Carrying value times the market interest rate.
Under the effective interest method of amortization, the interest expense is calculated by multiplying the carrying value of a bond with the market interest rate prevailing on comparable securities.

19,Bank loans to business firms:,are usually short-term in nature.,are preferred by the banker to be self-liquidating.,may require compensating balances.,All of these options.,C,"The answer is
c. may require compensating balances.
a. Incorrect. A business will usually acquire a short-term loan for the need of working capital. In addition, long-term loans can be acquired to fund for large projects as well. Thus, it is incorrect to certify that bank loans are usually short-term in nature.
b. Incorrect. Bankers will be exposed to a potential collection loss and other risks when lending their funds to the borrowers. A self-liquidating loan will become risky if the related asset cannot generate a sufficient fund to cover for interest charges and principal repayment. In fact, bankers will prefer borrowers who can actively generate money from different business activities.
c. Correct.

20,True or false? A simple way to amortize a loan is to have the borrower pay the interest each period plus a fixed amount.,True,False,,,A,"True.
An amortized loan requires that the borrower repays the loan in parts. A simple way to amortize a loan is to let the borrower pay the loan interest in each period plus a fixed amount which should go to repaying the loan principal.","Loan Amortization Loan amortization refers to the process involved in repaying the loan.

A bank makes loans through the excess reserves that it possesses. Every bank is required to keep a certain amount as a reserve; this reserve is made from the deposits of their customers. But when there are excess reserves with the bank, they use them to make loans to their customers.
Reasons for incorrect options
Option a) is incorrect because demand deposits are not used to make loans.
Option b) is incorrect because a bank cannot use its total reserves to make loans.
Option d) is incorrect because required reserves are not used to make loans.","Bank Loans: A bank loan is identified as financial aid provided by the banks to people in need of money.

22,"If a term loan requires equal annual payments that retire the loan and pay the interest, that is similar to_.",mortgage payments,dividend payments,lease payments,a sinking fund,A,"Correct Answer: a
The structure mentioned in the given statement reflects the simultaneous payment of the principal and interest amount. This concurrent payment structure resembles the structure of mortgage. Also, the annual payment amount is similar to that is applicable in the case of a mortgage. So, because of the equivalent amount and simultaneous principal and interest payment, such a loan resembles a mortgage.
An explanation for incorrect options:
Option b: The dividend payments occur in equity, not in loans. Also, the dividend amount differs annually.
Option c: The concept of lease payments are different as they do not involve the principal payments.
Option d: The sinking fund involves contributions for future payments, not simultaneous payments.",Sinking Fund: A fund that creates safety for the bondholders by mentioning the early payment option in the prospectus is the sinking fund.

23,An interest-only loan is an example of a:,fully-amortizing loan.,loan with negative amortization.,non-amortizing loan.,partially-amortizing loan.,C,"The correct option is
c. non-amortizing loan.
We only serve the loan's interest during its tenure in interest-only loans and repay the entire loan at the end of its term. Because we don't repay the loan in between, the loan doesn't get amortized during the tenure. Therefore, it's a non-amortizing loan.
As is the case in all other options, the loan amount changes during the loan's term; they are
not
interest-only loans.","Loan: A loan is a type of financial transaction that businesses use to get funds for long-term purposes. Generally, companies procure capital assets with the help of loans. Loans increase the leverage of companies."
24,"Assuming all else is equal, which of the following loans is most likely to have the lowest total interest payments?",Unsecured non-amortizing loan.,Unsecured amortizing loan.,Secured non-amortizing loan.,Secured amortizing loan.,C,"The correct option is
(c) Secured non-amortizing loan.
Generally, secured loans have lower interest rates than unsecured loans, so if the loan is most likely to have the lowest total interest payments, it must be a secured loan.
Usually, the total interest payment is lower under the constant principal repayment as here the principal repayment is fixed for all the years.
Thus the loan that is most likely to have the lowest total interest payments would be a
secured non-amortizing loan.","Loan: The loan is an arrangement between the lender and the borrower. A loan can be secured or unsecured, amortizing or non-amortizing based on the terms decided between the lender and the borrower."

B. Carrying value times the market interest rate.
Under the effective interest method of amortization, the interest expense is calculated by multiplying the carrying value of a bond with the market interest rate prevailing on comparable securities. The stated interest rate is the coupon rate used to ascertain the coupon amount (i.e. stated coupon rate times the face value) paid to the bondholders.","Amortization of Bonds: In the context of accounting, a bond is a debt instrument issued at a premium to the face value, at a discount to the face value, or at the face value.

27,"Before approving a loan application, a bank is likely to analyze the applicant's:",debt ratio,brand preferences,inflation rate,performance goals,A,"The correct answer is option
a. debt ratio
.
The debt ratio for an applicant is ascertained by dividing the total liabilities or debt by the total assets. A higher debt ratio signifies higher risk because the inability to pay a higher interest amount for the debt may cause bankruptcy. The evaluation of the applicant's risk is important because it helps a bank to decide whether to proceed with the loan disbursement or not. If the bank decides to disburse the loan then depending upon the risk magnitude, the interest rate can be finalized.",Loans: Loans represent borrowings of an individual or a firm for making investments or expenditures. The sanctioned loan amount and interest rate are usually finalized after taking into consideration the risk associated with the applicant.
28,"The type of debt nearly always repaid in full by the borrower, with a repayment rate of 97 percent, is _____ loans.",company-to-company,federally guaranteed,parallel,micro-,B,"The correct answer is B) federally guaranteed
Federally guaranteed loans are also referred Federal Family Education Loans (FFELs). When a borrower fails to repay a federally guaranteed loan, the federal government repays the banking institution and takes charge of the credit. The federal government repays around 97% of the principal amount to the moneylender. At this stage, the federal government possesses the credit loan and the right to receive clearance on loan.
Reasons for incorrect options:
Option A)  is incorrect because, in company-to-company loans, a company gives credit guarantees, procures securities, or puts their money in another corporate body. The company fixes the repayment rate.
Option C) is incorrect because a parallel loan involves two parent companies in distinct nations which take monies in their domestic currencies, then loans that sum to the other country's domestic subsidiary. At the loan's term expiry, the amount is remitted with interest, and the parent companies repay that sum to their domestic financial institutions.
Option D) is incorrect because a microloan is the precise compact loan amount that a person receives as a loan from a microfinance institution. The number of microloans differs from nation to nation.",Loan: A loan is an amount advanced by one party to another in return for security or charge. The principal amount is supposed to be repaid with interest. The interest rate is decided at the beginning of the agreement.

1. Option b. $11.60
2. Option b. $278.40
Given:
Loan value = $290
Annual interest rate = 16%
Loan period = 90 days
Number of days in a year = 360 days (approximately)
So, the interest would be:
1. Interest:
{eq}\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{Interest}}\, &= \,{\rm\text{Loan value}}\, \times \,{\rm\text{Interest rate}}\, \times \dfrac{{{\rm\text{Loan period in days}}}}{{{\rm\text{Number of days in a year}}}}\\

Option b: first go to your company's regular bank before considering a loan from an unfamiliar source

Option a: Taking a loan will impact the firm's cash flow as it will involve paying down the interest and principal amount at a stipulated time. Therefore, it will result in an outflow of cash. This option would be an inaccurate decision for the firm.
Option b: Banks always consider certain factors like credit score, repayment history, current income, and loan amount before lending funds to any firm. If a firm receives any loan offerings, it must consult with its regular banks for such matters and discuss relevant facts about loan taking, like assessing all costs, the ability of loan repayment, and interest rates, and checking any hidden gimmicky offers. Thus, this option is an accurate and correct decision.
Option c: If credit problems are prevailing in a firm's operation, then it must avoid taking a loan as it will have insufficient collateral and inconsistent cash flows for repaying and availing the loan. Thus, this option is also inaccurate.
Option d: If the firm considers loans as their funding source, then they are increasing liabilities for the firm which require cash availability at the time of their monthly installments.
