1,"""When people must pay higher taxes on their wage earnings, it reduces their incentive to work"" is a positive statement.",True,False,,,A,"The provided statement is
true
.
A positive statement is defined as one that possesses empirical evidence. This statement is regarded as positive when the established hypothesis can be changed, tested, or replaced.
The provided statement on taxes and earnings will involve analyzing the relationship study between them. This statement relies on relevant facts, associated figures, and data analysis.
Thus, the provided statement is a positive statement as it will establish cause-and-effect relationships among earnings, taxes, and incentives. Hence, it is true.","Taxable Income: Taxable income denotes the individual's gross income less certain exemptions or deductions, on which the tax rate is applied to compute income payable to tax authorities. It involves salaries, bonuses, tips, and unearned income."
2,Earned Income Tax Credits:,decrease tax liability and are phased out,increase tax liability and are phased out,decrease tax liability and are not phased out,increase tax liability and are not phased out,A,"Earned Income Tax Credits
a. decrease tax liability and are phased out
Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) are credits for low-income individuals and families. They are adjusted or phased out as income increases. They never increase a taxpayer's liability and are permanently phased out as income rises. The difference between a tax credit and a tax deduction is that a tax credit is subtracted from the bottom line of what the taxpayer owes, while a deduction offsets the taxpayer's gross income.",Earned Income Tax Credit: The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is for those working and earning a low to moderate income. It is a credit rather than a deduction or exemption.
3,"Assume that the government imposes a 30% tax on your income and deducts $8,000 from the result. Under a negative income tax scheme, if you earn $30,000 a year, you will:","receive a tax credit of $1,000","receive a tax credit of $8,000","have a tax liability of $1,000","have a tax liability of $8,000",C,"In the given case, the tax imposed is
30%
. For income of
$30,000
, the expected tax level is as follows
$$\begin{align}

\text{Expected Tax} = 30\% * $30,000

\end{align}

$$
$$\begin{align}

\text{Expected Tax} = $9,000

$$
However, the government deducted $8,000 from the income. This means that the tax payer is in tax arrears of {eq}$9,000 - $8,000 = $1,000 {/eq}.  The expectations are that the tax payer will submit
$1,000
to the state.
Correct Answer: c. have a tax liability of $1,000","Negative Income Tax Scheme Under the negative income tax scheme, an income threshold that earners are expected to pay tax is set such that earners whose income is above that level are expected to pay some money to the state. Those who earn an income below the set threshold will receive some money from the state."
4,"At the end of the year, employees are given Form 1099-Misc for the total amount of gross wages earned for the year.",True,False,,,B,"The statement is FALSE.

5,The effective federal unemployment tax rate is usually:,6.2%,0.8%,5.4%,8.0%,B,"The correct answer is option b. 0.8%.
The effective federal unemployment tax rate is usually 0.8%. We know that the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) imposes a statutory tax rate of 6.0% on the first $7,000 of each employee's wages. However, employers can claim a credit of up to 5.2% for their contributions to state unemployment insurance (UI) programs, thus reducing the effective FUTA tax rate to 0.8% (6.0% - 5.2%).
It is important to note that this rate may change if the employer is in a state with a credit reduction, which occurs when a state has outstanding federal loans for their unemployment insurance programs. In such cases, employers in that state may face a higher effective FUTA tax rate due to a reduced credit offset.
Therefore, the correct answer is option
b. 0.8%.","Income Taxation: Income tax serves as a significant source of revenue for the government, helping to fund essential public services and programs such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, defense, and social welfare programs."

8,Investors who wish to minimize the effect of taxes on their investment returns should try to avoid:,dividend-paying stocks.,short-term capital gains.,long-term capital gains.,municipal bonds.,B,"The answer is
B. short-term capital gains.
A. Incorrect. By investing in dividend-paying stocks, an investor will receive dividend income annually. The stock's dividend is taxed as an ordinary income. However, the amount of income tax charged on the dividend income is not significant since the dividend income consumes a small proportion of the total ordinary income.
B. Correct. Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, which generates a significant amount of tax liability since the amount of a capital gain is usually higher than interest income or dividend income. With that being said, the short-term capital gain raises the tax charges during the year.
C. Incorrect. A long-term capital gain is taxed at a lower rate (0%, 15%, or 20%), which allows a taxpayer to obtain tax savings during the year.
D. Incorrect.

30,"Everything else held constant, the interest rate on municipal bonds rises relative to the interest rate on Treasury securities when:",income tax rates are lowered,income tax rates are raised,municipal bonds become more widely traded,corporate bonds become riskier,D,"The correct option is A
; income tax rates are lowered.
The market for municipal bonds declines due to reduced income tax rates because investors' value of municipal bonds' tax-exempt status is steadily declining. This decreased demand drives down the price of municipal bonds and raises their yield (or interest rate).
Reasons for incorrect option:
B
. When income tax rates are raised, the demand for tax-exempt municipal bonds increases, driving their prices and lowering their yields. As a result, the rate of interest on municipal bonds is lesser than the rate of interest on Treasury securities.
C
. An increase in the trading of municipal bonds may lead to increased liquidity in the market, which may lower the yield on municipal bonds due to bigger demand.
D
. The rate of return on municipal bonds or Treasury securities would not be immediately impacted by the riskiness of corporate bonds. The interest rates of corporate bonds are set based on their perceived risk. In contrast, the interest rates of municipal bonds and Treasury securities are determined by other factors such as economic conditions, inflation, and monetary policy.","Municipal Bonds: Municipal bonds are instruments allocated by the federal government, local administrations, and certain public entities, like schools, utilities, and transportation authorities, to fund public projects."

Option C.
Education expenses are deductions when these are work-related. The MBA program attended by the corporate executive is related to his work and enhances his skills, so the qualified education expenses are a deduction from the income tax.
Analysis of other options
A. An accounting degree is not related to the work of a real estate broker. So, it is incorrect.
B. A building contractor's license is different from the work of a CPA. So, it could not be an educational expense.
D. Bookkeeper and CPA are different jobs, so the review course for CPA is not an educational expense.","Itemized Deduction: Some itemized deductions, which reduce income tax, are property taxes, mortgage interest, charitable donations, sales tax, and medical and dental expenses."
33,The Bush tax cut reduced the top income tax bracket from 39% to 35% over a ten-year period. Supply and demand analysis predicts the impact of this change was a _____ interest rate on municipal bonds and a _____ interest rate on Treasury bonds.,higher; lower,lower; lower,higher; higher,lower; higher,D,"The correct answer is option A
.
The Bush tax cut reduced the top income tax bracket, which made municipal bonds less attractive to wealthy investors because the tax advantage of owning these bonds decreased. As a result, demand for municipal bonds decreased, which led to a higher interest rate.
On the other hand, treasury bonds are not affected by the tax cut as they are exempt from state and local taxes. Hence, the tax cut did not make them less attractive to investors, and their demand remained stable. Consequently, the interest rate on treasury bonds did not change significantly and remained lower than municipal bonds.
Reasons for incorrect option:
B
: The tax cut would have made municipal bonds less attractive to investors and decreased demand. So, the interest rate on municipal bonds would have gone up.
C
: The tax cut only affects municipal bonds' demand, not treasury bonds; hence, the interest rate on treasury bonds would not increase significantly.

34,"Deena purchased a small business in 2004. One of the assets was goodwill, the cost of which was $300,000. For 2014, Deena may deduct amortization of how much?",$-0-,"$20,000","$10,000","$30,000",B,"The correct option is b. $20,000.
When a taxpayer purchases the net assets of another business, and these assets include goodwill, they are allowed a deduction for the amortization of goodwill over
15 years
. This means that Deena can deduct $300,000 ÷ 15 = $15,000 of goodwill amortization per year for 15 years from 2004, so until 2019.

35,The distinction between investment grade debt and non-investment grade debt is best described by differences in:,Tax status.,Credit quality.,Maturity dates.,,B,"The correct answer is option (b).
The difference between investment grade and non-investment grade bonds is related to the difference in credit quality, not the tax status or maturity date. Bond markets are categorized based on the creditworthiness of the issuer as assessed by the rating agency. Moody's Investors Services Baa 3 or higher, or Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings BBB- or higher ratings are considered investment eligible. In contrast, ratings below these levels are called non-investment eligibility (also known as high yield, speculative, or junk).

Option A: Determines the tax rate applied to income. It is possible to file as a single person, a married couple filing jointly, a married couple filing separately, a head of household, or a qualified widow(er) with dependent children.
Option C: The term ""maturity date"" describes the day on which the investor is entitled to receive their principal investment, such as that represented by a bond, note, or other types of debt instrument, back.","Investment Grade Debt Securities Any bond, debenture, note, or other evidence of indebtedness that has received ratings of at least BBB- (stable) from Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Baa3 (stable) from Moody's Investors Services, Inc. is considered to be an investment grade debt security."
36,An increase in income tax rates will always result in an increase in government tax revenues.,True,False,,,B,"The correct option is
False
The tax burden rises as the tax rate rises. It may boost income slightly in the short term, but it will have a much bigger impact in the long run. It decreases taxpayers' take-home earnings, which in turn limits their discretionary spending. The economy's aggregate demand drops, and as a result, manufacturers make fewer goods. As a result, the unemployment rate rises. Since the government receives a smaller share of the population's income, its tax base shrinks and its revenue drops.","Income Tax: Income tax is levied on the income of the people by the government to get revenue that could be spent further on social welfare such as subsidies, economic development, and investments. Social Security, etc."

option D.
All the answers are relevant to deciding whether the activity is profit-seeking or a hobby.
A. The way the taxpayer carries out the activity. If it's maintaining complete and accurate records, it is profit-seeking; otherwise, it is a hobby.
B. The activity is profit-seeking when the taxpayer is an expert on that activity or has advisers who are experts in that field.
C.

The choice (c) is correct because accrual basis taxpayers can defer tax payments to the next tax year if the provision of services is not made in the current tax year.
The choice (a) is incorrect because prepaid income is recorded when services are delivered while in tax and financial accounting the income and tax reports are recorded during the payment period.
The choice (b) is not correct because the cash basis taxpayer usually gives the income and tax report when the payment is received not when the services are provided.
The choice (d) is incorrect because income and tax reports should be yearly not on an undefined period where services are provided.","PREPAID INCOME Prepaid income is a fund received by the seller before services provision. It is considered a liability and recorded as a current liability on the balance sheet. Once the delivery is done, the fund is recorded as revenue."
40,Married taxpayers may double their standard deduction amount by filing separate returns.,True,False,,,B,"The statement is FALSE.
If married taxpayers decide to file separate returns, each of them will be allowed to take the standard deduction as a single taxpayer. Thus, their total amount of standard deductions is equal to the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly.

Sometimes part of your spending for landscaping, whether you do it yourself or use a professional business, may be deductible. Although the term ""landscaping"" is not specifically defined in the tax laws, Interpretation Bulletin IT-296 suggests that the majority of costs are deductible as long as the work is done primarily for aesthetic rather than purely utilitarian reasons and the area is intended to be made more attractive. These may involve laying sod, re-sloping the land, planting flowers, trees, and shrubs, among other things.","Capital Assets According to the definition of a capital asset, any type of property owned by the taxpayer, is related to their line of work or not counts as a capital asset.

In this case, the taxpayer is not eligible for any deduction because the purpose of the trip is personal. A taxpayer can get a deduction if the trip is for business purposes.
b.
In this case, the taxpayer is not eligible for any deduction because the taxpayer spent a small part of the trip for business purposes. The main motive of the trip was personal, not professional.
c.
In this case, the taxpayer is eligible for a deduction.
Calculate the tax deduction as follows:
$$\begin{align*}

{\rm\text{Tax deduction}} &= {\rm\text {Travel expense}} \times \dfrac{{{\rm\text {Days spent on business}}}}{{{\rm\text {Total days of trip}}}}\\

&= {\rm\text {\$ 1,800}} \times \dfrac{{\rm\text {6}}}{{{\rm\text {10}}}}\\

44,What type of deductions is directly deducted from the Gross Income?,Deductions for AGI.,Tax-exempt income.,Tax credit.,Itemized deductions,A,"The correct option is
Option a: Deductions for AGI
.
Option a:
The deductions for AGI are considered ""above the line"" deductions, which means they are reduced directly from gross income. Some of those are educator expenses, 401(k) contributions, and health-related saving account contributions. Thus, this option is correct.
Option b:
The federal state or tax authority doesn't implement the income tax on certain income from sources that are treated as tax-exempt income. These incomes are to be disclosed in the exempt income schedule. Thus, this option is also inaccurate.
Option c:
The tax credit amount implies deducting the amount from the taxpayers' tax due. It will lower the taxable income amount. Thus, this option is inaccurate.
Option d:
Itemized deductions are accounted for in computing taxable income and deducted from the computed adjusted gross income.

B. rise during periods of prosperity, thus reducing federal budget deficits.
Periods of prosperity refer to the economic condition where the economy experiences high growth and development. During this period, there is increased demand for goods and services and increased employment, which increases the living standard of the individuals. The excess demand results in increased inflationary pressure on income. To control inflation, the government will impose income tax to reduce the disposable income of the entities in the economy. A federal budget deficit takes place when expenditure exceeds the income of the government within a certain period. However, increased income tax increases the government's income, thus decreasing the federal budget deficit.
The other options are incorrect.
A. fall during periods of prosperity, thus increasing federal budget deficits.
Income tax rises during periods of prosperity to reduce inflationary pressure, which decreases and does not increase the federal budget deficit.
C. fall during recessions, thus increasing the problem of unemployment.
The option is partly correct as income tax falls during the recession to increase the disposable income of the individuals, which decreases the unemployment problem and not increases it as the employers will no longer lay off workers if its cost decreases through a fall in income taxes.
D. rise during recessions, thus increasing the problem of unemployment.
The income taxes fall and do not rise during the recession to increase the income of the individuals and decrease the severity of the recession through increased spending.
