1,The Black-Scholes option pricing model is dependent on which five parameters?,"Stock price, exercise price, risk-free rate, probability, and time to maturity.","Stock price, exercise price, risk-free rate, variance and time to maturity.","Stock price, risk-free rate, probability, time to maturity, and variance.","Exercise price, probability, stock price, variance and time to maturity.",B,"The correct answer is
b) Stock price, exercise price, risk-free rate, variance and time to maturity.
The pricing formula is as follows:
{eq}SN(d_1) - KN(d_2)*e^{-rt} \\

\delta = N(d_1),\\

\displaystyle d_1 = \frac{ln(S/K) + (r + \sigma^2/2)t }{\sigma\sqrt{t}}\\

d_2 = d_1 - \delta \sqrt{t}

{/eq}
where
K
= strike price
S
= current stock price
{eq}\sigma{/eq} = volatility of the asset
t
= time to expiry
r
= risk-free rate
N(.)
= the standard function",The Black-Scholes Model: This is a widely used model for pricing financial assets. It is an equation used to guess how financial instruments vary over time. The model is used for option pricing.
2,"_____ is the relationship between the value of a stock, bond and the call and put options on the same stock and the same exercise price.",Dividend exclusion,Limit law,Put-call parity,Put option equality,C,"The answer is
C) Put-call parity
.
The put-call parity is a concept used to value options. It is used to determine the price for a put option that has the same strike price and expiration date as a given call option. The equation for this is the following:
C + PV(x) = P + S
, where:
C
- current value of a call option
PV(x)
- present value of the strike price
P
- current value of a put option
S
- spot price","Options: Options are derivatives, that is, financial securities whose value is dependent upon the value of an underlying asset. The two main types of options are call options and put options which give investors the right whether to buy or sell an asset."
3,a. Suppose you enter into a short 6-month forward position at a forward price of $60.,,Suppose you buy a 6-month put option with a strike price of $60.,"Comparing the payoffs of parts (a) and (b), which contract should be more expensive (i.e., the long put or short forward)? Why is this so?",,A,"a. With a short position in a forward contract, you enter into an agreement to sell the underlying asset at the  forward price of $60. When the contract expires, you will earn a profit is the price of the underlying asset is lower than the forward price, and a loss if otherwise. Specifically, the payoff in 6 months is given by:
payoff to forward contract =  forward price - spot price at expiration
Applying this formula, the payoff at different prices is:
if price is 50, payoff = 60 - 50 = 10
if price is 55, payoff = 60 - 55 = 5
if price is 60, payoff = 60 - 60 = 0
if price is 65, payoff = 60 - 65 = -5
if price is 70, payoff = 60 - 70 = -10
b. The payoff to put option is given by:
payoff = max(0, strike price - spot price at expiration)
Applying this formula, the payoff at different prices is:
if price is 50, payoff = max(0, 60 - 50) = 10
if price is 55, payoff = max(0, 60 - 55)  = 5
if price is 60, payoff = max(0, 60 - 60) = 0
if price is 65, payoff = max(0, 60 - 65)  = 0
if price is 70, payoff = max(0, 60 - 70)  = 0
c. The option should be more expensive, because the payoff to the option contract is less risky. If we compare the two payoffs, the upside profit is the same between forward contract and a put option, but the downward loss is limited with a put option. This is because the option holder could choose not to exercise the option if the spot price at expiration is unfavorable. Since put option provides a higher payoff in the future, its cost must also be higher at the present day.","Put Option: A put option provides the buyer the rights, but not the obligations to sell the underlying asset at the exercise price (also called the strike price). When the option is exercised, the payoff to the holder of the put option is higher if the spot price of the underlying asset is lower."
4,The payoff to the holder of a put option is:,strike price minus stock price if stock price is more than strike price,strike price minus stock price if stock price is less than strike price,stock price minus strike price if stock price is less than strike price,stock price minus strike price if stock price is more than strike price,B,"The answer is
B) strike price minus stock price if stock price is less than strike price
Holding a put option aims to protect the investment of securities when the market falls down. When the market price of securities decreases, investor can still sell securities at a strike price, which is higher than the market price. With that being said, the potential profit would be equal to strike price minus the market price.","Put Option: A put option represents a right to sell underlying securities at a fixed price on the expiration date of option. Note that, this is not an obligation that the put option holder must exercise the transaction."
5,Which of the following is true upon the exercise of a short put?,The writer is required to make a closing purchase if they do not own the underlying stock for delivery.,The writer would have to make a closing sale if they cannot accept delivery.,The writer is required to accept delivery of the underlying stock.,The writer is required to deliver the underlying stock.,C,"The answer is c.
Since the writer sell the right to purchase the underlying securities in the future, if the put buyer exercise the option, the writer would have to accept the delivery of underlying securities.",Short Put: A short put refers to an action that the investor writes or sell a put option on particular underlying securities. It means the writer sells the right to buy the underlying securities at a predetermined price in the future.
6,"In case of normal swings in the risk-free rate, option prices are not very sensitive to changes in the risk-free rate.",True,False,,,B,"The statement is false. The risk-free rate is one of the factors that affect the price of the option. The increase in the risk-free rate increases the value of the call option. Alternatively, the rise in the risk-free rate lowers the price of the put option. Hence, option values are sensitive to the risk-free rate.","Call option A call option is one of the options strategies to subscribe to an underlying asset at a fixed price and time, which is an agreement between individuals to earn a profit. It used for speculation and arbitrage purposes. It is a kind of option in the market."
7,Suppose that a stock sells at a price of $40 on the expiration date. Compute the payoff to the seller of a call option if the option strike price is $50.,-$20,-$10,0,$20,C,"The answer is
C. 0
The seller of a call option needs to sell underlying securities to the buyer of that call option at the strike price.
In this case, the strike price is higher than the market price, in which the option will not be exercised by the holder.
Hence, the payoff is $0, addressed below:
Payoff = Min (Strike price - Market price, 0) =  Min ($50 - $40,0) = 0","Option: An option is a derivative that represents a right to sell or purchase underlying securities at a specific price in the future. Note that, the buyer of an option will not be obligated to exercise the transaction."
8,The Black-Scholes formula gives the price of an American call option.,True,False,,,B,"The correct answer is
b. False
.
An American option is a type of option that gives its holder the right to purchase or sell an asset at any time before the expiration date. In contrast, a European option can be exercised only at a specified date. The Black-Scholes formula is used to estimate the price of a European option as it gives us only one price. Hence, the price of an American call option cannot be determined using this model.",Options: Options are financial instruments whose price is dependent upon the price of another asset called the underlying asset. The price of an option can be determined by using the Black-Scholes model.
9,"When you purchase a put option while still holding the underlying stock, it is known as a:",protective put,protective call,speculative put,speculative call,A,"The answer is
A) Protective put.
A protective put indicates two simultaneous transactions:
Purchase of securities will be processed. Or, an investor might currently hold securities.
Investor will buy a put option that has underlying securities as same as his holding securities.
By this strategy, when the price of holding securities drops down, the put option provides a protection to investor since he can sell his securities at the strike price. If the price of securities increases, investor will have unlimited profit.","Put Option: A put option is a derivative that represents the right to sell underlying securities at a fixed price in the future. Note that, it is not obligation that requires an option buyer to execute the transaction on the expiration date. Instead, the option buyer can close their position by not exercising the option and accepting the loss of premium fee."
10,KD Industries stock is currently trading at $32 per share. Consider a put option on KD stock with a strike price of $30. The maximum value of this put option is:,$0,$32,$30,$2,C,"The answer is
C) $30
The maximum value of a put option occurs when the underlying securities become worthless. In that case, the maximum value would be the strike price, which is $30.","Put Option: A put option represents a right to sell underlying securities at the strike price. A put option buyer would expect the market price of securities falls down in the future. Note, the option buyer could select not to exercise the option at the expiration date."
11,A share of stock is a _____ option on the assets of the firm with a strike price equal to _____.,"put option, face value of debt","call option, market value of equity","call option, face value of debt","put option, market value of equity",C,"The answer is
C) call option, face value of debt
If the value of the firm is greater than the firm's liabilities, equity holders will receive the net asset of the business, which is computed by subtracting debt from firm's total assets. Alternatively, shareholders will receive whatever is left on assets after debt is paid off completely.
If the value of the firm is less than firm's liabilities, bankruptcy will be filed and shareholders will earn nothing on firm's assets.",Option: An option refers to a right to buy or sell underlying securities at a specific price in the future. It helps investors to protect their investment portfolio when market has high degree of uncertainty.
12,"A firm owns a put option on 10,000 barrels of oil with a strike price of $37.50 per barrel.",Does the firm exercise the option if on the day the option expires the price of oil is $40 per barrel?,What is the cash flow on the day the option expires if the price of oil is $40 per barrel?,,,A,"a) No. The market price of oil is $40 per barrel, which is more than the strike price of $37.50 per barrel. Since this is an options contract, the firm is not obligated to sell the oil barrels on the date of expiry of the contract. The firm has the choice of not exercising the option till the time the strike price exceeds the market price.
b) Cash flow on the day of expiry of the option will be equal to the payoff from the options.

24,A call option on euros is written with a strike price of $1.30/euro. Which spot price maximizes your profit if you choose to exercise the option before maturity?,$1.35/euro,$1.25/euro,$1.30/euro,$1.20/euro,A,"The correct answer is option A.
$1.35/euro.
If the spot price is less than the strike price ($1.30/euro), exercising the option will result in a loss because you would buy euros at a higher price than the current market rate. If there are two prices, the spot price, and the strike price, an individual should choose the higher spot price corresponding to the strike price to get more profits.
Assuming that the increase in the spot price has covered the premium paid for the option, the profit from exercising the option can be calculated as follows:
Profit = Spot price - Strike price
The spot price should be above the price of the strike for the option exercise to be profitable. The only option that meets this criterion is A) $1.35/euro from the given answer choices.
Therefore, if you exercise the call option at a
