A
The short run production keeping K=10 is;
{eq}\begin{align*}

q &= 0.2LK + 5{L^2}K - 0.1{L^3}K\\

q &= 0.2L\left( {10} \right) + 5{L^2}\left( {10} \right) - 0.1{L^3}\left( {10} \right)\\

The marginal product of labor is the change in the output (q) if one more unit of labor (L) is employed:

MPL &= \dfrac{{\partial q}}{{\partial L}}\\

MPL &= 2 + 100L - 3{L^2}

On the other hand, average product of labor is ratio of the total product of labor to the labor:
{eq}\begin{align*}

q &= 2L + 50{L^2} - {L^3}\\

APL &= \dfrac{q}{L}\\

APL &= \dfrac{{2L + 50{L^2} - {L^3}}}{L}\\

APL &= 2 + 50L - {L^2}

Maximizing the average product of labor implies finding its first derivative and putting it equal to zero. Thus;
{eq}\begin{align*}

APL &= 2 + 50L - {L^2}\\

-	A is suboptimal because certificates of deposit have a lock-up period that can't be violated without penalty.
-	D. is suboptimal, because municipal bonds are generally considered to be less liquid than corporates.
