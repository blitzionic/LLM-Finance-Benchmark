1,The main purpose of a budget is to:,develop goals.,develop a financial plan.,give feedback to the plan.,monitor and control financial outcomes.,D,"The correct answer is
d. monitor and control financial outcomes.
A budget's main purpose is to monitor and control financial outcomes because planning and tracking help improve financial situations. It is re-evaluated periodically and helps to monitor the estimation of revenue and expense. It tracks the savings and sets a framework for policy formulation.",Budget A budget is a detailed plan expressed in quantitative terms or the mechanism for translating fiscal objectives into projected monthly spending patterns. A budget helps to meet personal goals with a system of saving and wise spending.
2,A limitation of budgeting is that it _____.,fixes control yardstick,gives management by expectation,does not ensure results,sets a plan of policies,C,"The answer is
C. does not ensure results.
A limitation of budgeting is that it
does not ensure results.
A budget provides funding for a project and essentially places a cap on resources project managers will have available. Teams will need to properly distribute funds and resources to ensure tasks can adequately be completed. Establishing a budget does not ensure results will be attained. Inadequate funding may result in an incomplete project or lower quality than necessary. Simply setting a budget does not ensure a team will be able to accomplish its task.
The other three options are all benefits of budgeting, not limitations. Budgeting does set a yardstick on funding that will be available for a project. Teams may finish the project under budget and return funds. Alternatively, the team may need to request more funds. Establishing a budget sets a good yardstick or goalpost for the team to plan around with respect to funding. Budgeting does set expectations for management regarding how much money they should plan to spend. Budgeting will also set policy on funding and often will include rules on how money can be spent. All three of these items guide a team in its decision-making process.",Budgeting: Budgeting is the process of setting aside funding for a specific task or project. Budgets may be firm or modifiable depending upon the resources available. Budgets limited by resources will require efficiency by the team to meet goals and expectations. Budgets may be limited arbitrarily to preserve resources for alternative projects. Exceeding a budget may result in cost overruns or termination of the project at a total loss depending upon the circumstances of funding.

15,Which of the following amounts of a flexible budget change with changes in sales volume?,selling price per unit,total fixed costs,variable expense per unit,total contribution margin,D,"The correct answer is option
D) Total contribution margin.
The total contribution margin is determined by deducting the total variable cost from the total sales revenue. Flexible budget changes with the actual activity level; hence, the total sales revenue and variable costs will also change with the sales volume. However, the total fixed costs remain constant within a relevant range of activity levels for a given period. The unit metrics, such as the selling price per unit and variable expense per unit, are also considered constant.
Since the total variable costs and total sales revenue change with the sales volume, we can infer that the total contribution margin will also change.","Budgeting: The budgeting activity is usually carried out for the forthcoming period to keep track of various metrics such as costs, revenues, and cash flows. One may prepare the budget by considering the static or flexible budgeting method."

Static budget: It is based on expectancy relating to output and inputs, expense, and revenue over a particular period.
Option b
, ""Total fixed cost,"" is the correct answer.
a. Total variable cost: this cost varies with the unit of production and the static budget does not allow for variable cost changes.
b. Total fixed expense: It has nothing to do with production. Thus, it remains fixed irrespective of the unit of production.
c. Contribution margin: Variable costs are deducted from total sales to find out the contribution. As a result, this creates a distinction between static and flexible budgets.
d. Total revenue: Total revenue is the amount of income generated from operating activity. It is based on actual results, while static is based on expected data. Thus, this can not be a reason for the similarity between flexibility and static.
e. None of the above: the similarity between the two budgets is due to total fixed costs.",Budget A budget is a statement prepared on an annual basis.

18,The __________ reveals whether or not additional sales revenue can offset an increase in costs in the flexible budget performance report.,static budget variance,actual variance,sales volume variance,flexible budget variance,C,"Option C, i.e., sales volume variance, is the correct option.
It is because the increase in sales can be determined by calculating the sales variance. It helps analyze whether such increased sales offset the costs of creating flexible budget statements. It can be used to identify the products that contribute the most to the overall sales or gain insight into other products that may need to be marked down or discontinued.
Explanation for incorrect options:
Option A: Static budgets are used for the evaluation of both sales performance and the ability of cost center managers to keep spending under control but not increase costs in the flexible budget performance report.
Option B: Businesses regularly use actual variance evaluation to evaluate their fees or revenues; however, it does not cause price growth in the flexible budget performance report.
Option D: A flexible budget is created at the end of the budget period.

This kind of budget is more concerned with day-to-day expenditure, i.e., operating expenditure. So it starts with figuring out the sales budget, which includes the cost of goods sold, the cost and price per unit, and the overall sales revenue that the company can earn in a given period.
The other option is incorrect on the following basis:
Option A: Cash budget.
The cash budget is simply the estimation of  cash inwards and outwards of the company, which includes the opening cash balance along with the other cash flow sources. As the operating budget is based on estimating expenses and revenues, it's inappropriate to start an operating budget with the cash budget.
Option C: Budget for Overhead
The overhead budget is concerned with the estimation of manufacturing costs, where it neglects the cost of direct labour and direct materials that come under the cost of goods sold. So it is an inappropriate answer to the above question.
Option D: Budget Pro Forma
Pro forma budget is a wider concept that includes  operating, investing, and financing activities, so it is an inappropriate option to the above question.",Operating Budget The procedure used to regularly predict the company's incomes and expenses is known as the operational budget. It is more focused on the costs and revenues that the organisation will eventually experience.
32,Which one of the following is not a benefit of budgeting?,It provides assurance that the company will achieve its objectives.,It provides definite objectives for evaluating performance.,It requires all levels of management to plan ahead on a recurring basis.,It facilitates the coordination of activities.,A,"The correct answer is
A. It provides assurance that the company will achieve its objectives.
The budgeting process involves setting objectives and making plans to achieve them. However, the actual performance of a company is affected by various factors that are not accounted for in the budgeting process. Therefore, budgeting cannot assure that a company will be able to meet its objectives.

(d) appears on periodic budget reports
.
Budget reports are prepared for internal use. These reports typically have at least three columns: the actual results, budgeted expectation, and the budget variance. Budget reports are prepared for each cost, profit, and investment center. They are used to communicate results to middle management, to control costs, and to evaluate performance. Budget reports often form an essential part of management compensation agreements.
The other options are wrong:
(a) Is done by the external auditors
is wrong because the external auditors are not responsible for preparing any reports. External auditors review reports prepared by management and express an opinion on their reasonableness.
(b) Appears on the company's external financial statements
is wrong because budgets and budget variances are not included in financial statements prepared for external use.
(c) Is usually done orally in departmental meetings
is wrong because budget variances are calculated and communicated in formal, written reports.",Planned Results: Most companies plan their operations using budgets. Larger corporations prepare several budgets and supporting schedules for each division and aspect of their operations. The planned results as per the budgets are then compared to the actual results to calculate budget variances.
34,An appropriate activity index for a college or university for budgeting faculty positions would be the:,faculty hours worked.,credit hours taught by a department.,number of administrators.,number of days in the school term.,B,"The correct option is b) credit hours taught by a department.

35,"If the supplies flexible budget is higher than the supplies planning budget, the variance is:",Favorable,Unfavorable,Not enough information to determine,None of the above,B,"If the supplies flexible budget is higher than the supplies planning budget, the variance is
B) Unfavorable
.
The planning budget is always the reference point when labeling activity variances, which are the variances between the flexible and planning budget variances. This means that when revenues are higher in the flexible budget than in the planning budget, the variance is favorable (because operating income will be higher than the reference operating income). Likewise, when expenses are higher in the flexible budget than in the planning budget, the variance is unfavorable (because operating income will be lower than the reference operating income).
In flexible budgeting, this is somewhat counter-intuitive, because we realize that when the flexible budget for an expense, like supplies, is higher than the planning budget, it means that the actual activity level is higher than the planned level, and this is usually a good thing. However, the labels for the variances must be what it is for the math to work out.","Flexible Budget Variances: Two variances are calculated in the flexible budget performance report; the revenue/spending variances are based on differences between the actual and flexible budget amounts, while the activity of volume variances are based on differences between the flexible and planning or static budgets."
