1.0,A firm's capital structure consists of which of the following?,Common stock,Preferred stock,Bonds,All of the above,D,"The answer is
d. All of the above
A corporation can raise capital from the following sources:
Common stocks: A firm will sell common stocks to public investors to raise common equity.
Preferred stocks: Compared to common stocks, investors will receive higher dividends.
Bonds: A firm can sell bonds to the public for debt capital. The firm will need to return the bond's principal to the investors.","Capital Structure: The firm's capital structure should be designed to optimize the firm's weighted average cost of capital. A change in the firm's capital structure will affect the cost of capital, which might change the investment decision.",D,
2.0,A firm's capital structure is the mix of financial securities used to finance its activities and can include all of the following except:,stock,bonds,equity options,preferred stock,C,"Correct Answer:
Option C. equity options
.
Equity options are short-term opportunities to make returns. It is a derivate that provides the investor a right to buy a call or sell a put option at the strike price. A capital structure, on the other hand, is made of sources of capital from various sources, such as equity capital, debt capital, and preferred capital. These sources are long-term sources that help a company maintain its long-term solvency.",Financing Activities: Financing activities include raising money and repaying it using long-term sources. The short-term sources of finance are reported under the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows.,C,
3.0,"A taxpaying, levered firm's optimal capital structure consists of equal amounts of debt and equity financing.",TRUE,FALSE,,,B,"The correct answer to the given question is option
b. False
.
An optimal capital structure for a taxpaying, levered firm is the proportion of debt and equity in the overall capital where the weighted average cost of capital is minimum for the firm. The proportion of debt and equity for the optimal capital structure is governed by the cost of debt and equity and hence they may or may not be equal.","Capital Structure: In the context of finance, the overall assets of a firm are usually funded by a mix of sources of funds such as debt and equity. The cost of debt is usually lower than the cost of equity as the risk associated with debt is lower as compared to that associated with the equity.",B,
4.0,"A taxpaying, levered firm's optimal capital structure is the mixture of debt and equity financing that minimizes the weighted average cost of capital.",TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The answer is
True
In the optimal capital structure, the mix of equity and debt is apt, such that the cost of debt shouldn't increase more than the cost of equity. The cost of capital, WACC, is minimized as the interest on the debt capital is tax-deductible; also the debt is tax-advantaged, compared to equity. The optimal capital structure leads to an increase in the shareholder's wealth, stock prices, and value of operations.","Dividend Payout: Indeed, the dividend payouts to the shareholders are not obligatory for the firm to pay each year. First, the debt holders' interest payments are paid, from the increase in the operating profits only then the dividends are paid out; for a firm financed with debt capital.",A,
5.0,"According to the tradeoff model of capital structure, which is true at the optimal capital structure?",The firm's stock price is maximized.,Earnings Per Share are maximized.,The total value of equity is maximized.,Return on Equity is Maximized.,D,"The correct answer is
option (a). The firm's stock price is maximized.
The optimal capital structure increases the firm's stock price by a factor of two. The capital structure refers to the sources of long-term funds used by the company to buy the assets for the business. The long-term funds include debt capital, common stock, and preferred stock. All the different sources of funds form the capital structure for the company. The optimal capital structure means, the best mix of debt and equity funds that maximizes the company's stock value and minimizes the company's cost of capital.
Reasons for incorrect options:
Option (b) is incorrect because earnings per share are maximized by buying back their own shares from the shareholders.
Option (c) is incorrect because the total value of equity is known by the multiplication of the current stock price divided by the currently outstanding shares in the market. The value of equity is not maximized by an optimal capital structure.
Option (d) is incorrect because the optimal capital structure does not maximize return on equity.","Capital structure: The term capital structure means the combination of equity and debt that is used to finance or fund the assets and processes of the business or company. The equity fund is more expensive, and the equity fund is also a permanent source of capital.",A,
6.0,"As a firm reduces the amount of debt in its capital structure,",The return on the firm's assets should increase.,The required return on debt should increase.,The required return on equity should fall.,,A,"a. Incorrect. According to Modigliani-Miller Proposition 1, the firm's return on assets is not affected by its capital structure.
b. Incorrect. As the amount of debt reduces, the firm's risk should be lower. Hence, its required return on new debt should be reduced accordingly.
c. Correct. According to Modigliani-Miller Proposition 2, the required cost of common equity is affected by the firm's capital structure. Due to a lower debt-equity ratio, the cost of common equity will reduce.","Return On Assets: Return on assets (ROA) is one of financial ratios to assess a firm's profitability. If the firm's ROA grows annually, it indicates that the firm is operated efficiently, in which its profit increases over years.",C,
7.0,Capital structure refers to the financing of long-term investments.,TRUE,FALSE,,,B,"The statement is
FALSE.
A firm's capital structure points out how the firm finances its assets through different sources of capital. Alternatively, it refers to the proportion of equity capital and debt capital, which is to encourage the firm's growth in the long run. In practice, a firm is expected to maintain a stable capital structure to minimize its cost of capital.","Capital Structure: Within a fundamental analysis, investors can evaluate the financial health of a firm through an assessment of its capital structure. Usually, a firm's capital structure will be analyzed by a group of leverage ratios.",A,

The introduction of debt into the capital structure is likely to increase the cost of equity.  This is because, debt elevates the level of risk associated with the company's future earnings and cash flows.  That said, given the case facts, it is not possible to definitively ascertain the impact on the cost of equity.
Part b.
Assuming no taxes and no change in the cost of equity, the new WACC is computed as follows:
WACC = Debt Weight * Cost of Debt + Equity Weight * Cost of Equity
WACC = .50 * .072 +.50 *.101 = .0865 or 8.65%","WACC: WACC stands for weighted average cost of capital.  It is a holistic cost of financing measure that considers a company's proportional utilization of all possible sources of capital.

9.0,"Generally, it is not wise to use_.",long-term debt to finance short-term assets,short-term debt to finance short-term assets,short-term debt to finance long-term assets,long-term debt to finance long-term assets,C,"The answer is
c. short-term debt to finance long-term assets
Usually, the loan term should match with the useful life of the project that is financed by that loan. That means short-term debt should finance short-term assets while long-term debt should fund long-term assets.
In fact, a firm might aim to stabilize its debt, in which it might acquire long-term debt and finance available short-term projects. This strategy ensures that the firm's debt capital and the cost of debt are under the firm's control.
In the other hand, if long-term assets are financed by short-term debt, the firm might involve the lack of capital to continue funding long-term assets if it cannot acquire new short-term debt after the maturity of the previous short-term debt. In addition, if the market interest rates are expected to increase in the future, the use of short-term debt to fund long-term assets will maximize the cost of debt to the firm.","Debt Capital: Within a business, its operation will be financed by both equity and debt capital. The need of capital in the future will decide how the firm's capital should be structured, which aims to minimize the overall financing cost.",C,

d. In perfect capital markets, leverage does not affect firm value.
Within a perfect capital market, the value of a firm will not be affected by its leverage. Alternatively, the use of debt and equity capital will not either increase or decrease the firm's value.","Leverage: Within a firm, the leverage refers to the firm's capital structure, in which it depicts how the firm's total assets are financed by debt and equity capital.

16.0,The optimal capital structure minimizes the firm's cost of debt. True or False?,TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The above statement is true.
In the optimal capital structure, the firm tries to minimize its overall cost of its business by reducing the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the firm. WACC is calculated by adding cost of debt and cost of equity. Reducing the WACC means firm needs to reduce its cost of debt and cost of equity. Cost of debt may influence the choice of firm in forming capital structure, since low interest rates enlarge a firm's ability to issue higher debt. Higher debt will increase the WACC and thus affects the optimal capital structure, so it is better to minimize cost of debt to achieve best optimal capital structure.","Cost of Debt The cost of debt is the amount that a company has to pay on its debt, which is in form of interest on bonds and on loans.

This is the idea in which a firm determines the debt and equity finance appropriate to balance profits and expenses and one that can yield the highest value of the firm.
Options a, b and c are incorrect. Minimization of the financial distress course is not applicable under the trade-off theory of capital following the major aim, which is to maximize the firm's internal value. Also, interest tax shields that are highly applicable in debt are less of concern in balancing the firm value on its financial outcomes.","Capital Structure: Capital structure is defined as a mix of equity and debt that a company uses to finance its operations and assets in the business setting. It is the result of the factors of a company, such as maturity and size, that affect the financing options.",C,
18.0,The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a firm with an optimal capital structure is?,higher than the cost of equity.,lower than the cost of debt.,lower than the cost of unlevered equity.,independent of the capital structure.,C,"Correct answer is Option c.
The optimal capital structure includes both debt and equity. Debt is a cheaper source of financing for a firm due to the fixed nature of its payments and tax deductibility on its interest payments. Equity, on the other hand, is relatively more expensive because the cost is based on the expectations of the shareholders and no fixed dividends are paid.
The inclusion of debt in the capital structure lowers the overall cost of capital as it replaces the expensive equity. The financial leverage of the debt leads to fall in the WACC as more debt is used in the firm, thus making it lesser than the cost of unlevered equity.
The optimal capital structure will include such a level of debt that will minimize the WACC. Hence, the increase in risk to the equity shareholders as a result of more debt financing will not happen in this case.
Thus, the WACC for a firm with an optimal capital structure is lower than the cost of unlevered equity.
Explanation for incorrect answers:
a. It is incorrect because WACC, in this case, is not higher than cost of equity.
b. It is incorrect because WACC will never be lesser than cost of debt because cost of debt is fixed due to fixed interest payments. Moreover, a firm can never be 100% debt. Thus, the element of cost of equity will always be added to that of debt.
d. It is incorrect because debt is cheaper than equity and the inclusion of debt reduces the WACC. Even the MM Approach with taxes states that WACC is cheaper in case of levered firm over an unlevered firm. Thus, WACC is dependent upon the capital structure.",Optimal Capital Structure: Optimal Capital Structure is such a mix of different sources of long-term financing (including both debt and equity) which minimizes the overall cost of capital to the firm and maximizes the total value of firm.

Explanation:
Private companies makes use of the capital structure to calculate the weighted average cost of capital. The reason being, there is no market value for these companies.",Capital is known as the resources supplied to a business by the owners.

The expected rate of return on the company's shares is 12 percent.",What is the opportunity cost of capital for an average-risk Whispering Pines investment?,"Suppose the company issues debt, repurchases shares, and moves to a 30 percent debt-to-value ratio (D/V = 0.30 ). What will the company's weighted-average cost of capital be at the new capital structure? The borrowing rate is 7.5 percent and the tax rate is 35 percent.",,,A,"Summary:
Cost of equity = 12%
Cost of deb = 7.5%
Tax rate = 35%
Weight of debt = 30%
Weight of equity = 100% - 30% = 70%
a. Determine the opportunity cost of an average-risk investment:
Initially, the capital structure is all-equity firm, which implies that the firm's average cost of capital is also the cost of equity. Hence, an average-risk investment will have the same cost of capital as the firm. Alternatively, this investment engages an opportunity cost of 12%.
b. Determine the firm's WACC:
WACC = Weight of equity x Cost of equity + Weight of debt x Cost of debt x (1 - Tax rate)
WACC = 70% x 12% + 30% x 7.5% x (1 - 35%)
WACC = 9.86%","Weighed Average Cost Of Capital: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represents the firm's average financing cost, including all capital components.

177.0,According to the trade-off theory of capital structure:,optimal capital structure is reached when the present value of tax savings on account of additional borrowing is just offset by increases in the present value of costs of distress.,optimal capital structure is reached when stockholders' right to default is balanced by the the bondholders' right to get interest and principal payments.,optimal capital structure is reached when the benefits of limited liability is just offset by the value of the lawyers' claim.,none of the above,A,"The correct answer is
A.
Capital structure is defined as a specific plan of stock and debt used by organizations in funding their general activities and growth.  An outstanding capital structure should have the following elements, flexibility, control, maximum return, safety, less risk, economy, and capacity, among other elements. The theory involves balancing debt costs alongside the debt benefits. An organization should decide on the use of equity and debt finance to balance each's disadvantages and advantages. The theory explains that companies are funded partly by stock and partly by debt.","Capital: Capital is defined as the total amount of money used to start a business or invest in getting more profits. Various types of capital include financial, debt, equity, human and working capital, among others. The two sources of capital include debt financing and equity financing. In debt financing, the business borrows money in which they repay with specified interest. In equity financing, the money is invested in the business in exchange for fractional ownership.",A,
178.0,"As more debt is added to the capital structure of a firm, the cost of debt capital:","initially rises slowly, then falls beyond some point",increases at a steady rate throughout the entire range,"beyond some point, becomes greater than the cost of equity","initially rises slowly, then increases rapidly beyond some point",D,"Answer
is d. initially rises slowly, then increases rapidly beyond some point.
The main propositions of the traditional approach are:
The cost of debt capital remains more or less constant upto a certain level of leverage but rises at an increasing rate thereafter.
The cost of equity remains stable or grows slightly upto a certain level of leverage and rises rapidly thereafter.
As a consequence of the above behavior of cost of debt and cost of equity, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) decreases upto a certain point, remains constant and then rises, with increases in the proportion of debt in the capital structure.",Traditional Theory of Capital Structure The traditional theory of capital structure states that the cost of capital is dependent on the capital structure and there exists an optimal capital structure at which the cost of capital is minimum.,D,
179.0,"Calculate a firm's WACC given that the total value of the firm is $2 million, $600,000 of which is debt, the pre-tax cost of debt is 10%, and the cost of equity is 15%. The firm pays no taxes.",9.00%,11.50%,13.50%,14.40%,C,"The answer is
C. 13.5%.
The following formula usually estimates the weighted average cost of debt of a specific firm:
{eq}\boxed{\text{WACC=Cost of debt*Weight of debt + Cost of equity*Weight of equity}}

{/eq}
According to the capital structure theories the value of the firm is equal to:
{eq}\text{Value of the firm=Value of debt + Value of equity}

{/eq}
Therefore, given the firm's total value and the value of debt, we can estimate the value of equity, which will be used in the computation of weights.
{eq}$2,000,000=$600,000 + \text{Value of equity}

{/eq}
{eq}\text{Value of equity}=$2,000,000-$600,000

{/eq}
{eq}\text{Value of equity}=$1,400,000

WACC will thus be equal to:

In corporate finance, capital structure refers to a firm's composition of debts versus equity in financing its assets. There are various measures for a firm's capital structure, and the most commonly used one is the debt-equity ratio. All else the same, the higher the debt-equity ratio, the more levered a firm is because it uses more debt than equity in financing its assets.",Modigliani-Miller Theorem: The Modigliani-Miller theorem is an imperative postulate in the study of corporate finance. The theorem provides important theoretical foundations for firms to determine the optimal capital structure.,B,

If a firm engages a high business risk, it should optimize the capital structure with less debt, which refers to a lower financial leverage. The reason for this suggestion is to ensure that the firm will be able to meet its debt obligation when business risk arises. Alternatively, even when revenue reduces, the firm is still able to cover its debt payments.","Business Risk: In practice, business risks would refer to any types of risk that would have a negative impact to business profit. Or, a serious business risk might default the entire operation as well.",C,

In considering the firm's capital structure, it should
increase its debt
as it will maximize its value by optimizing the weighted average cost of capital. The debt provides  tax shield benefit  on interest payout to the firm resulting in lowering of the weighted average cost of capital. Except for equity, no other options are components of capital structure, and there is no benefit of tax shield in equity.","Shareholders Value: The Corporates are incorporating""increasing shareholder value""as one of the objectives in the vision statements.

b. the cost of capital
.
The objective of any firm is usually to have an optimal capital structure so that the overall cost of capital, which is also called as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), is minimum. A lower cost of capital helps in increasing the present value of the firm.","Capital Structure: In the parlance of finance, the capital structure is defined as the proportion of sources of funding such as common equity, preferred equity and debt in the overall capital of the firm.

c. business risk of the firm and the tax structure
.
For a firm, the optimal capital structure is the capital structure for which the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is minimum. The WACC in turn  is usually determined by taking into account the proportion of all sources of funding such as debt, common equity and preferred equity along with their respective costs. The corporate tax rate affects the tax of debt and hence the WACC value.
The cost of debt and equity is governed by the financial risk and business risk associated with the firm. Hence, it can be concluded that the minimum WACC value is governed by the optimum capital structure and the minimum value of WACC is governed by the business risk, financial risk and tax structure of the firm.","Optimal Capital Structure: In the parlance of finance, the capital structure for a firm signifies the mix of sources of funds used for financing the assets and operations of the firm.

is a. beyond
A firm which has a positive outlook ( that is firm expecting higher profitability) would use debt finance instead of selling stocks.
This is because, if the firm decides to sell stock when profits start accruing, the share price would rise sharply and new shareholders would be benefited as much as the current shareholders. Evidently, the existing shareholders would have benefited  more if the financing had not been through equity.
Therefore it would be more beneficial to the existing shareholders if management uses debt instead of equity to raise the funds","Signalling Theory The signalling theory is based on the premise of asymmetric information.That is, managers in general, have more information than outside investors about the future prospects of a firm.
