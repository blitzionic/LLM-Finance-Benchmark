The dividend growth model equation will use the following inputs to determine the cost of equity:
Expected dividend = R0.80
Current stock price = R22.40
Constant growth rate = 5%
Upon substitutin these inputs, we have the following output:

C. 14.3 percent.
The required rate for the market can be determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). CAPM utilizes the systematic risk or beta of a stock to estimate the returns required from an investment in that stock.

The required rate of return (RRR) refers to the minimum gains an investor would expect after investing in a particular security considering the risks and uncertainty associated with the security. If a stock is associated with high risk, the investor would invest in the same only with the intention of gaining high returns. So, for an investor to invest in a high-risk stock, it is a requirement that the stock is expected to provide higher returns, assuming that other things remain constant. So, with respect to the required rate of return on stocks, other things being the same, the higher the risk, the higher should be the required return.
The evaluation of the incorrect options is as follows:
A) As more investors become risk-averse, the required return will also drop if the risk is lowered: This statement is false because being risk-averse means being reluctant to take risks. This situation takes place with high-risk securities. Though the low risk is associated with low return, the risk-averse behavior of the investors is not the reason for the same.
B) Preferential stock often has a greater required return than common stock does. This statement is false because preference share has low risk, as compared to common stock. So, the RRR on preferred stock is generally lower as compared to the RRR on common stock.
C) The value of the stock increases as the investor's required rate of return rises: The value of the stocks is the result of the demand and supply forces in the market.

The required return on a firm's assets affects the COE. With higher required returns, COE should deliver higher returns. Hence, option a is wrong.
Option b:
With a surge in debt, there is an interest burden that the company has to take. In the event of default, the downside of debt holders is limited, whereas equity holders have an unlimited downside, which prompts them to increase COE. Hence, option b is wrong.
Option d:
A higher debt-to-equity ratio will lead to a higher COE. Hence, option d is wrong.","Source of Capital: Traditional sources of capital for any business were previously confined to equity and debt.

c. Rate of return on assets that covers the costs associated with the funds employed.
The overall cost of capital for a firm is ascertained by taking into account the sources of funds, their weight in the overall capital, and their respective costs.

This suggests that you should re-balance your portfolio to include more high-beta stocks.","If the market risk premium remains constant, but the risk-free rate declines, then the required returns on low-beta stocks will rise while those on high-beta stocks will decline.",A,"a. The answer is incorrect. If the market is to rise sharply, then the stocks with a high Beta will rise even more sharply than the market. Thus, you shouldn't sell them yet.
b. The answer is correct. A stock's Beta can be calculated by first dividing standard deviation of the stock by that of the market and multiplying the outcome by the correlation of the stock with the market. Now, since both stocks have the same standard deviation, stock B must have a lower correlation since it's value is smaller than that of stock A.
c. The answer is incorrect. Risk averse investors would prefer stocks with lower volatility/risk. However, high Beta stocks imply a higher volatility than the overall market.
d. The answer is incorrect. The required rate of return on a stock(RRR) in terms of risk free rate of return(Rf), market risk premium(MRP) and the Beta, is given by the following formula;
{eq}RRR = Rf+Beta* MRP

{/eq}
Looking at the formula above, we can easily see that if the Rf declines and MRP remains constant, then the stocks with a higher Beta will produce a higher RRR than the stock with a lower Beta.","Beta of a Stock ""Beta"" basically measures a stock's volatility in comparison to the overall market volatility. For example, a stock with a Beta of 1 has the same volatility as the market. On the other hand, a stock with a Beta of greater than 1 will have a higher volatility than the market; meaning it will go up more than the market if the market goes up, and go down more than the market if the market goes down.

217,Which one following will lower required rates of return?,Higher rates of inflation.,Lower rates of inflation.,Higher risk premiums.,Lower dividend yields.,A,"Option B, Lower Inflation Rate
is correct.
With a lower or decreased inflation rate, an investor's risk return also decreases. Returns are composed of real returns and inflation. Let's say an investor wants 10% returns from an instrument bifurcated into 4% as an inflation return and 6% as a real return. In this case, assume that the inflation rate has dropped to 3%. In this case, the investor will now get 9% as an expected return, as real returns are usually constant in normal conditions.
Option A: As the inflation rate rises, the RRR also rises because the investor must now earn more to compensate for the increased inflation. Hence, option a is wrong.
Option C: Higher risk premium attributed to the higher riskiness of an instrument. To cater to higher risk, an investor will seek higher returns, leading to a surge in RRR. Hence, option c is wrong.
Option D: Lower dividend yield indicates that the dividend paid is significantly lower in comparison to the market price. Thus, the investors want a higher RRR to compensate for the risk. Hence, option d is wrong.","Required Rate of Return: The Required Rate of Return (RRR)  is the minimum return an investor wants to achieve or requires against the instrument's risks.

379,The investor's required rate of return differs from the firm's cost of capital due to the:,firm's beta.,tax deductibility of interest.,CAPM.,time value of money.,B,"Correct answer is Option b.
It is the expectations of the investor for return that makes up the cost of capital for the firm. However, the two differ when there is an involvement of debt. The interest payable on debt is the cost of using debt as the source of financing.
Depending upon the riskiness of the investment and credit worthiness of the firm, the investor requires a minimum interest on debt.
However, interest on debt is deducted from the Net operating income before assessing the taxable amount. Thus, the cost of debt is lower for the firm as compared to the rate of interest paid to the investor.
Explanation for incorrect answers:
a: It is incorrect because the beta coefficient of the firm reflects the sensitivity of its returns with respect to the market rate of return. Since, it reflects the systematic risk on investment, the investor incorporates this element of risk into his required rate of return and chooses an investment which can compensate it for this risk.
c: It is incorrect because CAPM reflects the expected return based upon the risk-free rate of interest and market risk premium for the investor and that is included in cost of capital for the firm as well.
d: It is incorrect because time value of money calculates the absolute amount rather than relative percentages and the difference in cost of capital to the firm and the return to investor occurs in relative terms only.","Cost of Capital: The cost of capital refers to the compensation that a firm pays to its investors for the use of their funds.
