b. is preferred by businesses over the direct method.
Most companies use the indirect method to prepare the statement of cash flow, even though the accounting standards (both US GAAP and IFRS) encourage the use of the direct method. Under the indirect method, the cash flow from operating activities is derived from net income. Companies consider this the easiest method to apply.
The other options are wrong:
Option a. (starts by converting net income into an accrual-based number) is wrong because net income is already an accrual-based number. It would be correct to say that the indirect method starts by converting net income into an
cash
-based number because, under the indirect method, non-cash items like depreciation and the gains or losses on the sale of assets are removed from the net income to determine the cash from operating activities.
Option c. (reports a greater amount of cash than the direct method) is wrong because the cash from operating activities is the same, regardless of which method is used to calculate it.
d. (provides greater clarity for users than the direct method) is also wrong.

A. It covers a span of time and is dated the same as the income statement.
The cash flows of an organization are detailed and presented in the statement of cash flows over a specified time frame, usually a year. It details cash flow in and out, broken down by operating, investing, and financing functions. Like the income statement, the statement of cash flows provides coverage over a period of time. The balance sheet and the income statement are typically prepared for the same time period. When a cash flow statement and an income statement have the same date range, it's easy to see how the two relate to one another.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
B. It reports on the qualitative behavior of the company's performance. The statement of cash flows is more concerned with quantitative information, such as cash flows than it is with qualitative information, so choice B is incorrect.
C. It shows how the profits or losses of the company were generated. Since the statement of cash flows focuses on cash inflows and outflows rather than the causes of profits and losses, option C is incorrect. The income statement details the sources of any profits or losses.
D. It indicates when the long-term debt will mature. Option D is incorrect because the maturation dates of long-term debt are not shown on the statement of cash flows. This data is typically located in the balance sheet or in the notes to the financial statements.",Cash Flow Statement: The cash flow statement lists the cash inflows that the company earns from selling its products and services and also from other sources.

d. Determine the cash in all bank accounts.
Preparing a statement of cash flows does not require knowing how much money is in each bank account. The statement of cash flows details the inflow and outflow of funds over a specified time frame, breaking down these flows by operational, investment, and financing activities. Rather than detailing individual bank account balances, it sheds light on the flow of money associated with these endeavors as a whole. The cash balance, cash from operations, and cash from financing and investing are the three main components of the cash flow statement. Cash on hand is a vital piece of information for any financial manager, but it isn't strictly necessary for putting together a statement of cash flows.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
a. Determine the change in cash: Choice (a) is incorrect because calculating the cash flow change is a crucial part of creating a cash flow statement. It aids in determining whether cash has increased or decreased overall during the time frame.
b. Determine the cash provided by operations: Option b is incorrect because knowing how much money comes in and goes out of a company every day is impossible without first calculating the cash provided by operations.
c. Determine cash from financing and investing activities: Choice (c) is incorrect because analyzing financing (such as issuing or repurchasing stock) and investing (such as buying or selling assets) cash flows requires knowing how much cash was generated from these activities.",Cash Flow: One of the most important financial statements produced by the company each quarter is the cash flow statement.

8,Which of the following will increase cash?,Issues $2MM in new common stock,Invests $3MM in PPE,Generates negative net income and net cash flow,Increases dividend,A,"The right answer choice is option a.
a. Correct.
A new issue of common stocks will generate a cash inflow, which raises the firm's total amount of common equity.
b. Incorrect. Investments in PPE are recognized as long-term investments, which will lower the amount of cash available immediately.
c. Incorrect. A negative cash flow indicates that total cash disbursement is greater than total cash receipt during a year. Hence, there will be a decrease in cash.
d. Incorrect. Cash dividends will reduce the amount of cash. Thus, an increase in dividend payment will lower the firm's cash.","Free Cash Flow: A firm's free cash flow (FCF) is the amount of cash available at the end of each year, which is utilized for future business growth.

9,Which one of the following items is not generally used in preparing a statement of cash flows?,Additional information.,Adjusted trial balance.,Current income statement.,Comparative balance sheets.,B,"The correct option is
b. Adjusted trial balance
Accounts and their balances at the end of an accounting period are summarized in what is called an ""adjusted trial balance."" It serves as the foundation for other financial statements like the cash flow statement. Before generating the financial statements, the adjusted trial balance guarantees that all accounts have been properly adjusted for revenues, expenses, and other adjustments.
The explanation for other option:
a. Additional information: When providing specifics about cash flows that may not be directly reflected in the financial statements, supplementary information is often required. The items presented in the statement of cash flows can be supported or clarified with this data.
c. Current income statement: Revenues, expenditures, and net income (or loss) for a given time period can all be found on the current income statement, also called a profit and loss statement. The operating cash flows portion of the statement of cash flows relies heavily on the income statement, but the income statement is only a source of information and is not included in the statement itself.
d. Comparative balance sheets: Changes in a company's assets, liabilities, and equity between two time periods can be seen in a comparative balance sheet. Cash flows from investing and financing activities on the statement of cash flows depend on these adjustments. Changes in financial standing over time can be examined with the help of comparative balance sheets.","Cash Flow Statement: The statement of cash flow, also known as the ""cash flow statement,"" refers to a periodic statement that reports the movement of cash such as the inflow and outflow of cash during a specific time period.",,,B

is correct.
It is because cash flows are separate statements reported by the companies. This statement explicitly explains the movement of the cash flows and helps the investors or any other stakeholders review the firm's sources and the uses of cash flows over the year.
The other options are incorrect.
Option A. The Income Statement: It is incorrect because the income statement records all the incomes and expenses regardless of their nature (non-cash or cash).
Option B. Statement of Retained Earnings: It is incorrect because this statement shows the historical retained earnings of the company and the changes that occurred over the year.
Option D.

b. Increase in inventory
a. New issues of securities will generate more equity capital, which should be recognized as cash inflows.
b. Increase in inventory requires cash payments to suppliers. Hence, it refers to cash outflows.
c. Deferred taxes and wages imply that the firm does not need to make cash payments today. Thus, analysts can treat these transactions as cash inflows.

The next step would be to:,reduce our estimate by the increases in liabilities.,reduce our estimate by the decreases in assets.,increase our estimate by the increases in liabilities.,do nothing more because we have an accurate estimate.,C,"The correct answer is C.
increase our estimate by the increase in liabilities.
Financial obligations and reductions in the asset are adjusted to the net income to estimate cash flows. Similarly, any financial obligations and asset revenue fall are subtracted from net income.
Reason for incorrect options:
Option A
Increases in liabilities typically indicate that the company owes more money in the future, which would reduce the cash flow rather than increase it.
Option B
Decreases in assets, such as decreased accounts receivable, indicate that the company has collected cash from customers and therefore has more cash available. So, adjust the cash flow estimate upward by the amount of the decrease in assets, and not downward.
Option D
Adding depreciation expense to net income provides a more accurate cash flow estimate, but it is still incomplete. It needs to be adjusted for changes in non-cash current assets and liabilities to arrive at an accurate cash flow estimate.","Cash Flow Analysis: Using cash flow analysis, a company's management can better comprehend the amount of cash a business has earned and how effectively it has used it during a particular financial year.",,,C
