1,Financial capital does not include:,stock,bonds,preferred stock,working capital,A,"The correct option is
D, i.e., working capital
.
Explanation:
Working capital is the money available to a firm to fulfill its short-term operating expenditures and commitments. It is essential for a company's day-to-day operations since it can pay for costs. It may be accomplished by optimizing cash flow, maintaining inventory levels, and collecting outstanding consumer debts more efficiently. Thus, it is not financial capital for a company.
The explanation for the incorrect options:
Option A: Stock is financial capital that a company issues to its shareholders to generate capital through those investments.
Option B: Bonds are the financial capital a company issues to raise funds which will be introduced into the company for furtherance.
Option C: Preferred stock is a type of financial capital that firm issues to raise funds from the owners or purchasers of the stock.","Financial Capital: Financial capital is available monetary resources to allow investment in new entities, infrastructure, and other initiatives. Financial institutions manage this capital and provide services to people and firms.",,,D
2,"Historically, the most widely accepted goal of financial management has been to:",analyze the risk associated with investments.,organize and manage a firm's resources.,help a firm fulfill its social responsibility.,maximize the value of a firm to its owners.,D,"The correct option is
d. maximize the value of a firm to its owners.
Explanation:
In the past, the main focus of financial management was on maximizing shareholders' wealth. The ways were identified to provide increased returns to the shareholders. These returns were in the form of dividends and stock appreciation (increase in the value of the stock).
Explanation for incorrect options:
Option a. It is incorrect because analyzing the risks related to the investment was not the primary goal.
Option b. It is incorrect because, in the early periods, there was no focus on the efficient utilization of resources.
Option c. It is incorrect because social responsibility is a goal of the modern era.",Financial Management: Financial management is referred to as a technique used to manage and control the financial resources of a business entity. It assists the management in achieving its short-term and long-term objectives by measuring the current performances.,,,D
3,"If the current assets and working capital of a concern are Rs. 80,000 and Rs. 50,000 respectively then current liabilities will be:","Rs. 1,00,000.","Rs. 70,000.","Rs. 1,30,000.","Rs. 30,000.",D,"The correct answer is option
d. Rs. 30,000
.
The amount of current liabilities is given by:
{eq}\begin{align*}

&= \text{Current assets - working capital} \\[0.3 cm]

&= 80,000 - 50,000 \\[0.3 cm]

&= 30,000

\end{align*}

{/eq}",Working Capital: The working capital of a firm gives an estimate of the net funds available with a firm after paying off the short-term current liabilities. This metric is useful for a period of less than 1 year or 1 operating cycle.,,,D
4,Maximization of shareholder wealth as a goal is superior to accounting profit maximization because:,it considers the time value of the money.,following the shareholder wealth maximization goal will ensure high stock prices.,a and b.,accounting profits are not the same as cash flows.,A,"The answer is
option A.
The maximization of shareholder wealth is when the company has invested in capital or a project that increases the firm's value. Its calculation considers all the future cash flows of the said investment, so these are discounted to today's value to evaluate if it increases the company's value. Because of that, it indeed considers the time value of the money. In contrast, accounting profit maximization considers only the current business performance, like the revenue generated and the profit earned. Option B is incorrect because maximizing shareholder wealth does not assure that stock prices will increase. Option D is also wrong because the statement does not mean maximizing shareholder wealth is superior to maximizing accounting profit. Thus, option A is correct.",Profit Maximation: Profit maximization is one of the company's goals to achieve its objectives of being successful in the future. It applies to generating revenue in its daily operations and making decisions on capital investments because these must be profitable to be pushed through.,,,C
5,"True or False: An increase in current assets increases net working capital, thereby reducing the risk of technical insolvency.",True,False,,,A,"The statement is true.
A company's cash convertibility is measured by its net working capital, which evaluates if it has sufficient current assets to meet its current liabilities. Trade Payables and accrued expenses are liabilities a business must pay off during a year. Assets that can quickly convert into cash, such as closing stock and sundry debtors, are considered current assets.
The difference between current liabilities from current assets is termed net working capital. A specific commercial division's capacity to fulfill its existing aging commitments (less than twelve months) is called technical solvency. Thus, if there is an increase in current assets, there will be an increase in net working capital by reducing technical solvency risk.","Working Capital: Working capital is a liquidity measure in the company. The business has the resources to pay off the short-term obligation if there is positive working capital. If it is negative, then there is a credit crunch.",,,A
6,"Using the maturity-matching principle, which of the following types of assets should be financed with long-term financing?",Fixed assets only,Fixed assets and temporary current assets,Fixed assets and permanent current assets,Temporary and permanent current assets,C,"Answer
C. Fixed assets and permanent current assets.
Under aggressive financing policy, long-term funds are utilized to finance fixed assets and a part of permanent current assets The remaining part of permanent current assets and the entire temporary current assets is financed by short-term funds. This approach is risky because part of the permanent working capital is financed by short-term sources, which may lead to liquidity problems.
Under the conservative policy, long-term financing is used to meet fixed asset requirements, permanent current assets, and a portion of temporary current assets. The remaining portion of temporary current assets is financed by short-term funds. This will reduce the risk of short-term cash shortages but will reduce long-term profitability.
Under the maturity matching principle, the maturity of the sources of finance matches the maturity of the assets being financed. Long-term financing is used to meet fixed asset requirements and permanent current asset requirements. short term financing is used to meet temporary current asset requirements.
If a firm finances a long-term asset with short-term debt, then it will have to periodically refinance the asset whenever the short-term debt falls due. This is risky and also inconvenient. Hence this approach tries to ensure that the maturity of the asset and the life of the source of financing is properly matched.","Working Capital Financing Policy A firm can use different strategies to finance its capital requirements. These strategies are (1) conservative strategy, which involves low risk (2) aggressive strategy, which involves high risk, and (3) matching principle.",,,C
7,Which of the following is a debt management service offered by commercial banks?,Leasing,Factoring,Brokerage,Safe keeping,B,"The correct answer is B.Factoring.
Explanation:
1. Factoring is a method banks use to sell their account receivables to a third party to obtain or recover the loan amount and meet immediate needs.
2. The commercial bank sells the details of its accounts receivable to a third party, which immediately pays the receivables after deducting the basic factorage commission. This third party is then in charge of collecting the total loan amount and interest.
3. Banks use factoring as a powerful tool for debt management and to prevent bankruptcy.",Debt Management Debt management is the process or technique of creating an action plan that aids in reducing an organization's debt load. Debt management is essential for handling urgent needs.,,,B
8,Which of the following ratios would best disclose effective management of working capital by a given firm relative to other firms in the same industry?,a high rate of financial leverage relative to the industry average,a high number of days' sales uncollected relative to the industry average,a high turnover of net working capital relative to the industry average,a high number of days' sales in inventory relative to the industry average,A,"Option C is correct.
A high turnover of Net working capital indicates effective management of working capital. It clearly shows how effective the current assets are utilized for meeting the current liabilities and generate revenues.
Explanations for other options
Option A: A high rate of financial leverage indicates that the investment made by the company are highly risky and hence earnings of the company are highly volatile.
Option B: Days sales uncollected means the average collection period. Higher the average collection period is not good for a company.
Option D: Days sales in inventory are more means the company is taking more days to sell its products in the market. Also, it indicates that there is no proper inventory management in the company.","Working capital management: Effective management of short-term assets and liabilities is known as working capital management. When there is efficient management of working capital, the company will have sufficient liquid funds to meet its current obligations.",,,C
9,Working capital management is primarily concerned with the management and financing of _____.,cash and inventory,current assets and current liabilities,current assets,receivables and payables,C,"Correct Answer:
Option c. current assets
.
We use the following formula to determine the working capital:
Working capital = Current assets - Current liabilities
Working capital is all about managing and financing the current assets so that the current obligations can be met. It is also used to manage the needs of daily operations.
Why other options are incorrect?
a. cash and inventory
Cash and inventory form part of the current assets and don't constitute total current assets.
b. current assets and liabilities
Working capital doesn't manage or finance the current liabilities. It instead helps repay them using current assets.
d. receivables and payables
Receivables are part of current assets and don't constitute total current assets. Payables are current liabilities and are not managed by the working capital.","Liquidity: Liquidity means a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations that are due within a year. A company's liquidity position can be understood by looking at its liquidity ratios such as cash, current, and quick ratios.",,,B
10,Working capital to support the demands of a new project must be funded with cash. The assets primarily associated with such working capital requirements include:,inventory and accounts receivable.,machinery and equipment.,land and buildings.,all of these.,A,"The correct option is A.
A. The correct option because when a company takes on a new project, it may need to increase its inventory levels to meet the demand for its products or services. This requires cash to purchase or produce the additional inventory.
Accounts receivable represents the amounts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services that have been sold but not yet paid for. When a company takes on a new project, it may need to extend credit to its customers to make sales. This results in an increase in accounts receivable, which ties up cash until the customers pay their bills.
The explanation for the incorrect option:
B. The incorrect option is because Machinery and equipment are typically long-term assets that are used to support a company's operations over years. While these assets may be used in a new project, they are not typically associated with working capital requirements because they do not tie up cash in the same way as inventory and accounts receivable.
C. The incorrect option is because land and buildings are typically not considered part of working capital requirements because they are long-term assets that are not typically used in the day-to-day operations of the business. While they may be necessary for the project, they are not directly related to the company's ability to fund the working capital needs of the project.
D. The incorrect option is because the correct answer is A, inventory, and accounts receivable. These assets are the primary drivers of working capital requirements and need to be funded with cash to support a new project. By contrast, machinery and equipment and land and buildings are typically funded with long-term financing and are not directly tied to a company's short-term cash needs.","Working Capital: Maintaining a healthy working capital balance is essential for the financial health of a business, as it ensures that the company can continue to operate and grow without running into cash flow problems.",,,A
77,A small company needs fixed capital to expand and grow the business.,True,False,,,A,"The statement is true.

78,An arbitrary amount assigned by the board of directors to each share of a given class of no-par stock is:,Redemption value.,Liquidation value.,Quasi-par value.,Stated value.,D,"Answer: Option d.
Stated value refers to the value or amount allocated to a share for the purposes of internal accounting. This is done when a given stock does bot have a par value. It should be noted that a relationship does not exist between the stated value and the market price of shares. On the other hand, liquidation value refers to the amount the shareholders would get if a corporation makes discontinuation of its business operations. The shareholders would receive this amount after the corporation has settled all its debts or liabilities.","Corporate Finance Corporate finance engages in corporate funding sources, the structure of capital, and the decisions the management engages on behalf of the company and the shareholders.

79,"Answer True or False: If a company gets into financial difficulty, it can use some of its shareholders' equity to pay its bills for a time.",True,False,,,B,"The statement is false. Shareholder's equity is the claim of the shareholder on the assets of a company and it is indicated on the liability side of the organization's balance sheet. Shareholder's equity, therefore, has already been put into use for a company to acquire assets. If it were dividends, then the company can suspend issuing of the dividend to shareholders to settle the company's bills for some time. However, as it stands, the owner's equity is the amount of money that shareholders would claim if the company assets get liquidated and after the company has paid off all its debts.","Corporate finance Corporate finance deals with corporation capital structure, funding sources, and decisions or the actions that are made by company managers to ensure that an organization increases in value for the benefit of shareholders.

80,Enterprise Value represents the:,Market Value of Equity plus the dollar value of all 'in-the-money' dilutive securities.,Equity plus gross debt.,Value attributable to the owners of the business.,Value of all capital invested in a business.,C,"Answer: Option
C. Value attributable to the owners of the business.
Enterprise value refers to a measure of a given organization's total value. It is employed when calculating valuation ratios or metrics in case of a takeover. Therefore, enterprise value is equivalent to market capitalization plus total debt (short and long-term). Cash and other cash equivalents are not included in the determination of the enterprise value. In other words, it is the value of the company's operations that are attributed to the shareholders (those who provide capital) of a company.","Corporate Finance: Corporate finance deals with the decisions that managers make that are aimed at increasing the value of the company's stock. Also, it deals with the sources of corporate funding and the structure of the corporate capital.

82,"Ideally, which of the following type of assets should be financed with long-term financing?",Fixed assets only,Fixed assets and temporary current assets,Fixed assets and permanent current assets,Temporary and permanent current assets,C,"Answer
is C) fixed assets and permanent current assets
Under conservative policy, long term financing is used to meet meet fixed asset requirements, permanent current assets and a portion of temporary current assets
Under aggressive policy, long term financing is used to finance fixed assets and a part of permanent current assets. The remaining part of permanent current assets as well as the entire temporary current assets is financed by short term funds
Under matching policy, long term financing is used to finance fixed assets and permanent current assets, while short term financing is used to finance temporary current assets.
This is an ideal method of financing because the maturity of sources of finance matches the maturity of assets being financed. If a firm finances a long term asset with a short term debt, it will have to refinance the asset periodically as and when the short term debt becomes due..This is risky as well as inconvenient. Hence it is better to match the maturity of assets and the sources of finance.",Working Capital Financing Policy Determining the financing mix for its current assets is one of the important decisions in working capital management.

d. It is important to understand why the profits reported on a company's income statement differ from the actual cash generated by the firm's activities.
The accounting rule being used to report earnings may allow some items which may not be real earnings. Finance adjusts them to analyze true earnings. Hence knowledge of accounting is important.
Let's analyze the incorrect options:
a. Net income is used to calculate the net present value (NPV) of a proposed investment. - NPV is calculated using cash flows and not Net Income.
b. Companies distribute net income to shareholders in the form of dividends. - True, but it doesn't have anything to do with the problem at hand.

Part 2.
None of the cash flow information necessary to evaluate the project was provided.  Nonetheless, I can provide clear guidance with which to evaluate the project in question.  If the MIRR (modified internal rate of return) is greater than the risk-adjusted hurdle rate for the company, accept it.  Otherwise, reject it.
Part 3.
The answer is c. modified internal rate of return.  The modified internal rate of return (MIRR) technique converts a project's cash flow using a more consistent reinvestment rate than the internal rate of return (IRR) technique.  The MIRR assumes cash flows are reinvested at the firm's cost of capital and the initial outlays are financed at the firm's financing cost.  Conversely, the IRR assumes cash flows are reinvested at the IRR itself, which can lead to overly optimistic outcomes.
Part 4.
The answer is b. 48.43%.  Rationale is below.
The market value (MV) of each component is computed below.
MV Common Stock = 10,000,000 * $32.00 = $320,000,000
MV Preferred Stock = 20 million * $20.00 = $400,000,000
MV Bonds = 100,000 * $1,000 * 1.06 * $106,000,000
The MV Capital = $320,000,000 + $400,000,000 + $106,000,000 = $826,000,000
Therefore, the weight of the preferred stock is $400,000,000 / $826,000,000 = .4843
Part 5.
