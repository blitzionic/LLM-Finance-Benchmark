The formula for compound interest is:
$$A(t)=P\left( 1 + \dfrac{r}{m} \right)^{m \cdot t} $$
where:
{eq}A(t) {/eq} is the accumulated value at the time {eq}t {/eq}.
{eq}P {/eq} is the principal or the initial amount of investment.
{eq}t {/eq} is the number of years.
{eq}r {/eq} is the annual rate of interest.
{eq}m {/eq} is the number of compounding periods per year.
{eq}t {/eq} is the time in years.
In the given problem, we are given {eq}P=5,000 {/eq}, {eq}t=4 {/eq}, and {eq}r=2%=0.02 {/eq}.
a.
If the compounding period is annual, it follows that {eq}m=1 {/eq}.
Hence, substitute {eq}P=5000,r=0.02,t=4,m=1 {/eq} into the formula and solve for {eq}A(4) {/eq}:
$$A(4)=5000\left( 1 + \dfrac{0.02}{1} \right)^{1 \cdot 4}=5412.1608 $$
Thus, the accumulated value at year 4 is approximately {eq}\$5,412.16 {/eq}.
b.
If the compounding period is monthly, it follows that {eq}m=12 {/eq}.
Hence, substitute {eq}P=5000,r=0.02,t=4,m=12 {/eq} into the formula and solve for {eq}A(4) {/eq}:
$$A(4)=5000\left( 1 + \dfrac{0.02}{12} \right)^{12 \cdot 4}=5416.074655 $$
Thus, the accumulated value at year 4 is approximately {eq}\$5,416.07 {/eq}.
c.
If the compounding period is continuous, we need to use the formula {eq}A(t)=Pe^{rt} {/eq} where {eq}e {/eq} is the Euler's constant.
Hence, substitute {eq}P=5000,r=0.02,t=4 {/eq} into the formula and solve for {eq}A(4) {/eq}:
$$A(4)=5000e^{0.2 \cdot 4}=5416.435338 $$
Thus, the accumulated value at year 4 is approximately {eq}\$5,416.44 {/eq}.
d.
If the compounding period is quarterly, it follows that {eq}m=4 {/eq}.
Hence, substitute {eq}P=5000,r=0.02,t=4,m=4 {/eq} into the formula and solve for {eq}A(4) {/eq}:
$$A(4)=5000\left( 1 + \dfrac{0.02}{4} \right)^{4 \cdot 4}=5415.355756 $$

5,"Find the value of an investment of $1,000 in an account:",bearing 4.5% simple interest after 30 years.,bearing 4.5% interest compounded monthly after 30 years.,,,A,"We'll use the following formulas to determine an investment's worth using various interest calculations:
a. Simple Interest: The following formula can be used to determine simple interest:
$$A = P(1 + rt), $$

A is the total sum.
P stands for the initial investment's capital.
r is equal to the period interest rate.
T is the total number of periods.
The principal sum is {eq}\$1,000 {/eq} in this instance, the interest rate is {eq}4.5~\text{%} {/eq}, and the repayment duration is 30 years.

b. Compound Interest (compounded monthly):
The formula for calculating compound interest with monthly compounding is:
$$A = P\left (1 + \dfrac{r}{n} \right )^{nt)} $$
where:
A = the final amount
P = the principal amount (initial investment)
r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
n = the number of times interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years

c. Interest is calculated on both the original principal and on all interest accumulated since the beginning of the interest period.
Interest charged on a compounded basis implies that interest is calculated on the initial principal and the interest accumulated since the beginning. So, the interest keeps increasing with each period, and the money multiplies at a faster rate when compared to simple interest. Thus, compound interest makes investments more desirable but debt riskier.

10,"When interest is paid on both the principal amount and prior interest earned, this is called:",accounting rate of return.,the discount factor.,compound interest.,simple interest.,C,"The correct answer is option c. compound interest.
Compound interest is a type of interest that is applied not only to the principal amount of an investment or loan, but also to the interest accrued during the lifetime of that investment or loan.
For example, if a savings account earns compound interest where interest is compounded monthly, then the interest earned at the end of each compounding period, or month in this case, is added to the balance of the account, and then interest accrues on that amount as well as the principal amount invested.
The explanations for why the other answer options are incorrect are as follows:
Choice A. Accounting rate of return:
This is not a correct option, because an accounting rate of return is used to calculate the profitability of an investment as opposed to being a type of interest earned on an account.
Choice B. The discount factor:
The discount factor is not a type of interest, but rather, it is used to calculate the present value of future cash flows. Thus, this is not a correct answer option.
Choice D. Simple interest:
This option is not correct, because simple interest is a type of interest in which interest is only paid on the principal amount and not on any prior interest earned.","Principal Amount: In accounting and finance, the term 'principal amount' refers to original amount invested in an interest-bearing account or investment.

11,Which of the given interest rates and compounding periods would provide the best investment?,"2% per year, compounded semiannually","2% per year, compounded monthly","2% per year, compounded continuously",,D,"When everything else is held constant, a higher compounding frequency always yields a higher investment. This is because the interest is added back into the investment more often, meaning that future interest calculations are made with a larger balance. If interest is compounded semiannually, it is compounded twice per year. If it is compounded monthly, that is 12 times per year. Continuously compounded interest is a little different, as interest is compounded more frequently than once per second! Thus, continuously compounding is the highest compounding frequency, and we want to use that.
We can illustrate this problem with some calculations to support our claims. The following three calculations use an initial balance of $1000 placed into an account earning 2% interest for 10 years. The only difference is the compounding frequency. The first calculation uses semiannually compounded interest, the second uses monthly compounded interest, and the third uses continuously compounded interest. While the differences in the final amount are slight, we can see that continuously compounded interest does yield the highest amount in the end.

The principal amount here is $10,000 and the interest rate is 10% or 0.1. Since the deposit has been made for 20 years, the time period taken would be 20 years. The amount after 20 years can be estimated by using the formula below:

{/eq}
Here, A is the amount after 20 years, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, n is the number of times compounding happens which is taken as 1 and t is the time period which is 20 years. Substitute the values and solve for A as below:
{eq}\begin{aligned}   A&=\$10,000{{\left( 1+\frac{0.1}{1} \right)}^{1*20}} \\   &=\$10,000{{\left( 1.1 \right)}^{20}} \\   &=\$10,000\times 6.72749 \\   &=\$67274.9 \\   &=\$67,275  \end{aligned}

214,"Two years ago, Marc paid $450 for a baseball signed by Andy Pettitte. The value of the card grew by 6% each year. If Marc sells the ball five years from now, what percent profit will he make?",50%,75%,25%,100%,D,"The answer is A, Marc will profit 50 percent if the value of the card grows by 6% each year.
The key to solving this problem is to perform a series of operations. As the final price will occur seven years after Marc bought the card for $450, the original price needs to be multiplied by 1.06 for the first year, then the product of that calculation multiplied by 1.06 for the second year. Each year will involve multiplying the previous year's product by 1.06, which represents the original price plus the 6 percent increase, or the value of 106 percent of the original price.
Marc Purchases the card for $450
End of the first year: {eq}$450 \times 1.06 = $477

{/eq}
End of the second year: {eq}$477 \times 1.06 = $505.62

{/eq}
End of the third year: {eq}$505.62 \times 1.06 = $535.9572

{/eq}
End of the fourth year: {eq}$535.9572 \times 1.06 = $568.114632

{/eq}
End of the fifth year: {eq}$568.114632 \times 1.06 = $602.20150992

{/eq}
End of the sixth year: {eq}$602.20150992 \times 1.06 = $638.3336005152

{/eq}
End of the seventh year: {eq}$638.3336005152 \times 1.06 = $676.633616546112

{/eq}
At this point, we can round off the price to $676.63.
To find out the percentage profit, we must subtract the original price from the final price, then divide that answer by the original price to find a decimal that represents the percentage profit.
{eq}676.63 - 450 = 226.63

{/eq}
{eq}226.63 \div 450 = 0.5036222222222222

As this is slightly over 50 percent, that tells us that the most accurate of the four answer choices is 50% profit from the baseball card.","Compound Interest: When calculating a value increase that occurs over several years, it is always important to remember that interest is compounded.
