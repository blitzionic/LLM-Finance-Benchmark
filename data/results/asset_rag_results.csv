Current assets are the liquid assets of a company and include cash as well as all assets that will be converted to cash within one year or one operating cycle. Merchandise inventory is the term used to refer to goods that a company holds for resale, so the expectation is for them to be converted into cash in the short term. Inventory is therefore a current asset. Accounts receivable and prepaid expenses are other examples of current assets.

The other options are wrong:

(a) Current liabilities is wrong because inventory is a resource the company controls, so it is an asset, not a liability. Accounts payable is an example of a current liability.
(b) Plant assets is wrong. Plant assets are long-term assets that are used in the company's operations, not held to be sold. Plant assets include equipment, vehicles, and buildings.

The correct answer is d. $274,000.



Given information:

Beginning total equity = $146,000
Revenue = $210,000
Expenses = $179,000
Liabilities = $97,000
The total asset amount can be calculated using the accounting equation, but total equity is required for that ending. Ending total equity can be calculated by adding revenue to the beginning total equity and subtracting expenses.

Step 1. Calculate the ending total equity:

{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Ending total equity} &=\text{Beginning total equity}+\text{Revenue}-\text{Expenses} \\ &=\$146,000+\$210,000-\$179,000 \\ &=\$177,000 \end{aligned} {/eq}

Step 2. Calculate the total assets using the accounting equation:

{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Total}\ \text{assets} &=\text{Ending total equity}+\text{Total}\ \text{liabilities} \\ &=\$177,000+\$97,000 \\ &=\$274,000 \end{aligned} {/eq}

8,The difference between an asset's cost and its accumulated depreciation is called,market value,fair value,book value,real value,C,"The correct answer is C. book value.

The difference between the cost of buying an asset and accumulated depreciation is the asset's book value. The cost of an asset is included in the financial statements at the time of purchase. The asset's depreciation is calculated for each accounting period. Using these details, the asset's book value is identified.

A. The current value of an asset as per the market price is called the market value. It is determined by external factors of a business, such as demand and supply. The market value is not the difference between the cost of an asset and accumulated depreciation.

B. Fair value is not related to the asset's cost or the accumulated depreciation. It is the value at which the buyer and seller of an asset agree to trade. The asset's market value and its chances for growth are considered to determine its fair value.

21,Link's Emporium decides to sell an old truck. The balance in the accumulated depreciation account related to this truck after its disposal would be:,zero,the cost of disposed asset,the amount of cash received from sale,the profit or loss resulting from the sale of the asset,A,"The correct answer is a. zero.

The accumulated depreciation account should be closed when the concerned asset for which depreciation is accumulated is sold. The sale entry requires debiting the account to close it (because it's a contra account with a credit balance). Once the sale occurs, the balance in the account will be zero.

Other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

Answer Options	Explanation
b. the cost of disposed of asset	It also becomes zero when disposed of.
c. the amount of cash received from the sale	It is called the sale value of the asset.
d. the profit or loss resulting from the sale of the asset	The profit or loss reflects in gain or loss on the disposal account and not accumulated depreciation.

22,Which financial statement would contain the following account balance: Gain on disposal of equipment?,Balance Sheet,"Income Statement

",Statement of Owners' Equity,Cash Flow Statement,B,"The correct answer is b. Income Statement.

Gain on asset disposal is a non-operating income that should be credited to the income statement to increase profits. A gain should be registered when the sale value exceeds the asset's carrying value. Per the nominal account's debit and credit rule, gains should be credited.

Other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

Answer Options	Explanation
a. Balance Sheet	It is impacted by the asset sale, and the effect is on the total assets (increase in cash and decrease in fixed assets).
c. Statement of Owners' Equity	This statement directly considers the net income and not the line items of the income statement to determine equity changes.

Ace Corporation should find out the loss incurred due to asset disposal, which can be determined using the asset's cost, accumulated depreciation, and sale value.

Loss on sale = (Asset cost - Accumulated Depreciation) - Sale value
Loss on sale = ($36,000 - $18,000) - $12,000
Loss on sale = $6,000
This amount will be debited to the income statement, reducing the net income by $6,000.

a. net income will increase by $12,000.        The sale value is not reported on the income statement.

29,Which of the following assets is eligible for bonus depreciation?,used office machinery.,qualified leasehold improvements.,a new delivery truck.,used office furniture.,C,"The correct option is C. a new delivery truck.

Bonus depreciation can be claimed only on brand-new tangible assets. As a tax break, bonus depreciation lets companies write off a larger chunk of the purchase price of eligible assets in the year they are put to use. A brand-new delivery truck is an example of an asset that could be eligible for bonus depreciation. That means a company can write off a sizable chunk of the price of a brand-new delivery truck in the same year it is purchased.

The explanation for other options:

A. used office machinery. There is no bonus depreciation for used office equipment. Used office machinery wouldn't qualify for bonus depreciation because it wouldn't be considered a new asset.
B. qualified leasehold improvements. Depreciation deductions may be available for qualified leasehold improvements, but bonus depreciation cannot. Assets with a recovery period of 20 years or less are eligible for bonus depreciation, while qualified leasehold improvements have a longer recovery period.
D. used office furniture. Used office furniture, like used office machinery, is not eligible for bonus depreciation. Bonus depreciation is typically only applicable to brand-new assets.

Other equities and current liabilities are shown on the equity and liabilities side of the balance sheet and hence options (C) and (D) are incorrect.","The balance sheet is part of periodic financial statements issued by companies.

Intangible assets are those that are not tangible but still have value for a business. Intangible assets, such as goodwill, copyrights, and patents, are recorded on a company's balance sheet. When a company is acquired, the difference between the purchase price and the value of the net assets is known as goodwill. Authors are given copyrights to protect their written or spoken works, and inventors are given patents to protect their innovations.

Investments, on the other hand, can be stocks, bonds, or equity in another company or entity. Despite their worth, investments are more properly categorized as monetary assets than intangible ones. Depending on the expected holding period, financial assets may be classified as current or noncurrent investments on the balance sheet.

Reasons why other options are incorrect:

a. goodwill. On the balance sheet, intangible assets such as goodwill, copyrights, and patents can be found.
c. copyrights. On the balance sheet, copyrights are classified as intangible assets.

A company's profitability can be quantified in relation to its total assets using the financial ratio known as return on total assets (ROTA). It shows how much money was made for how much money was put into the company's assets. Net income is divided by average total assets to get ROTA.

Reasons why other options are incorrect:

a. Current ratio: Since it is a liquidity ratio used to assess a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations, the current ratio is incorrect. It has nothing to do with calculating investment returns.
b. Asset turnover: You're wrong to call asset turnover a measure of a company's ability to turn its assets into profit. It is not a direct indicator of how profitable an investment has been.
c. Return on sales: Incorrect, as ROS is a profitability ratio used to assess how much money was made from each dollar of sales.

34,Which of the following is not one of the three major assets Brick & Mortar retailers must invest in?,People,Inventory,Company Cars,Real Estate,C,"The correct option is c. Company Cars

Physical stores, or ""brick-and-mortar"" stores, require three primary investments for normal business operations. These are people, inventory, and real estate. Company cars are not always a necessary investment that brick-and-mortar stores need to make.

While some stores may need vehicles for operational reasons like moving inventory or making deliveries, this is not always the case. For example, consider a small clothing boutique where they make and sell all their clothes in-store. They would not need to invest in company cars, because any supplies or inventory could be shipped to them, and if they did choose to offer delivery of their products to people's homes, they could use the post office as opposed to delivering the item themselves.

Hence, of the answer options provided, the one that is not one of the three major assets brick-and-mortar retailers must invest in is company cars.

The explanations as to why brick-and-mortar retailers need to invest in the other answer options provided are as follows:

Choice A. People: People, such as managers and employees, execute the daily operations of a brick-and-mortar business. Hence, this is an essential asset to invest in for these types of retailers.
Choice B. Inventory: The inventory of a business consists of the materials needed to produce the goods that are sold to customers. Without inventory, a company cannot produce its products, so this is another essential asset that brick-and-mortar retailers must invest in to be successful.
Choice D. Real Estate: As mentioned above, brick-and-mortar businesses are run at physical stores as opposed to businesses that conduct their business strictly online or from home. Hence, real estate must be purchased in order to develop and maintain this sort of business, making it an essential investment for brick-and-mortar retailers.","In business and finance, assets are defined as resources that a company uses to conduct its business in the short and long term.

35,Which of the following is representative of safeguarding assets?,Attaching electronic sensors to merchandise inventory,Reducing expense to increase operating profit,Increasing operating profit to increase net income,Allowing company accountants to handle cash,A,"The correct option is a. Attaching electronic sensors to merchandise inventory.


The term ""asset protection"" refers to the practice of taking precautions to prevent the destruction, loss, or misuse of a company's property. As an illustration of asset protection, electronic sensors could be attached to merchandise inventory. These sensors can detect when items are being moved or removed without authorization, which can help deter theft and beef up safety.

Reasons why other options are incorrect:

b. Reducing expenses to increase operating profit: Cutting costs to boost operating profit is unrelated to asset security. Although cost control is vital to a company's bottom line, protecting its physical assets is a separate issue.
c. Increasing operating profit to increase net income: Likewise, boosting operating profit in order to boost net income has nothing to do with securing assets. Instead of putting in place concrete safeguards for property, it prioritizes enhancing financial performance.
d. Allowing company accountants to handle cash: While it may be a part of internal control procedures, letting accountants handle cash is not a foolproof way to keep your company's money safe. Beyond the purview of accountants, a wider range of controls and measures is required to protect cash.","The term ""asset"" refers to the company's material, immaterial, temporary, and permanent assets that aid in its ability to generate income.

a. Building: If you convert the building into cash, you will need to wait a long time. So, the building is not the correct option.
b. Prepaid expenses: It could take a long time to get the stock in the prepaid expenses as the payment has already been made. So, this is not a very liquid asset.
c. Accounts receivable: The account receivables may take one or more years, and some receivables can go bankrupt.

Prepaid insurance shows the amount that has been paid for insurance for the future period and such expenses are not yet due.

Unearned revenue indicates the amount that has been received by the business against which the goods or services have not been provided yet. It is a liability for the business.

The owner's capital shows the amount invested by the owner in the business. It is a part of owner's equity.



Explanation for incorrect options

Accounts payable is a liability for the business and not an asset; hence option (a) is incorrect.

Asset disposal requires the depreciation at the time of sale to be up to date. It is because the profit or loss on the sale of an asset will be determined based on the asset's book value at the time of sale. The book value can only be determined if the accumulated depreciation reflects the depreciation charged up to the disposal date. Therefore, Options A, B, and C are incorrect.

43,Liquidity is a measure of how _____.,quickly an asset may be converted into cash,long an asset can be used,easily an asset can be exchanged for another asset,quickly an asset appreciates in value,A,"Liquidity is a measure of how quickly an asset may be converted into cash. That is, the correct answer choice is A.

Liquidity is the measure of how quickly an asset can be converted into cash. For this reason, cash is itself considered to be the most liquid asset. If an asset is highly liquid, it can be very easily and quickly converted to cash. On the other hand, an asset being less liquid indicates that it will take more time and effort to convert it into cash. For example, a check is a highly liquid asset, as the bank will convert it very quickly to cash with minimal effort.

The reasons for each of the other answer options being incorrect are as follows:

Choice B: This option is not correct, because how long an asset can be used doesn't have anything to do with how easily or quickly it can be converted to cash.
Choice C: How easily an asset can be exchanged for another asset doesn't describe liquidity accurately, because liquidity has to do with the speed and ease at which an asset may be converted to cash, not how easily it is exchanged for any other asset. Hence, this is not as precise or accurate of an explanation of liquidity as choice A.
Choice D: How quickly an asset appreciates in value has to do with how quickly its value increases over time, not how quickly it can be converted into cash. Thus, this is not a correct answer option.

The entry to record the gain or loss on the disposal of this machine would include:","A debit to loss in the amount of $3,500.","A debit to loss in the amount of $6,500.","A debit to gain in the amount of $2,500.","A credit to gain in the amount of $2,500.",D,"The correct answer is option d. A credit to gain in the amount of $2,500.

The net book value of the machine at the time of sale is computed as follows:

{eq}\begin{align*} &= \text{Original cost - accumulated depreciation} \\[0.3 cm] &= $12,000 - $9,000 \\[0.3 cm] &= $3,000 \end{align*} {/eq}

The gain or loss on the sale of the machine is computed as follows:

{eq}\begin{align*} &= \text{Sale value - net book value} \\[0.3 cm] &= $5,500 - $3,000 \\[0.3 cm] &= $2,500 \text{ positive value denotes a gain} \end{align*} {/eq}

An increase in assets or expenses is reported as a debit entry whereas an increase in liabilities or gains is reported as a credit entry. Since there is a gain of $2,500 on the disposal of the machine, it will be reported as a credit entry in the gains account.
