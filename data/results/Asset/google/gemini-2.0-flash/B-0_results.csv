        On December 31, Strike Company sold one of its batting cages for $55,000. The equipment had an initial cost of $310,000 and has accumulated depreciation of $260,000. Depreciation has been taken up to the end of the year. What is the amount of the gain or loss on this transaction?


        A) $10,000 loss

        C) $5,000 loss
        D) $10,000 gain
        ",B-0,B,"To determine the gain or loss on the sale, we need to calculate the book value of the asset and compare it to the selling price. The book value is the initial cost minus accumulated depreciation: $310,000 (initial cost) - $260,000 (accumulated depreciation) = $50,000 (book value). The selling price was $55,000. Therefore, the gain is $55,000 (selling price) - $50,000 (book value) = $5,000. Since the selling price is higher than the book value, there is a gain.",B

Instead, they are tested for impairment annually to determine if their fair value has declined below their carrying amount.

        A machine costing $171,600 was destroyed when it caught fire. At the date of the fire, the accumulated depreciation on the machine was $84,000.

2. **Calculate the gain or loss on disposal:** This is the difference between the insurance proceeds received and the book value of the asset. $203,800 (insurance proceeds) - $87,600 (book value) = $116,200.
3. **Determine the journal entry components:**
    *   Debit Cash for $203,800 (insurance proceeds received).

A fully depreciated building still in use is still a tangible asset used in operations. Option D, 'Long-lived tangible assets,' is too broad.
