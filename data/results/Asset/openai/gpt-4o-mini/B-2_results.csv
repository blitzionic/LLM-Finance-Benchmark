        On December 31, Strike Company sold one of its batting cages for $55,000. The equipment had an initial cost of $310,000 and has accumulated depreciation of $260,000. Depreciation has been taken up to the end of the year. What is the amount of the gain or loss on this transaction?


        A) $10,000 loss
        B) $5,000 gain
        C) $5,000 loss
        D) $10,000 gain
        ",B-2,B,"To determine the gain or loss on the sale of the batting cage, we first need to calculate the book value of the equipment at the time of sale. The book value is calculated as the initial cost minus accumulated depreciation. In this case, the initial cost is $310,000 and the accumulated depreciation is $260,000. Therefore, the book value is $310,000 - $260,000 = $50,000. Since the equipment was sold for $55,000, we can calculate the gain as the sale price minus the book value: $55,000 - $50,000 = $5,000.

        Sloan Company uses its own executive charter plane that originally cost $800,000.

Thus, the annual depreciation expense is ($800,000 - $80,000) / 10 = $72,000. Over six years, the accumulated depreciation would be 6 years * $72,000/year = $432,000. The net book value at the end of six years is the original cost minus accumulated depreciation: $800,000 - $432,000 = $368,000.

The gain on the sale of old machines is $140. The book value of the old machines sold can be calculated as follows: Book Value = Original Cost - Accumulated Depreciation. The accumulated depreciation on machines decreased from $1,400 to $1,300, indicating that $100 of accumulated depreciation was removed from the books, which corresponds to the old machines sold. Therefore, the book value of the old machines sold is $100. The cash received from the sale can be calculated as: Cash Received = Book Value + Gain on Sale = $100 + $140 = $240. However, since we need to consider the total cash received from all transactions, we also need to account for the new machine purchases of $1,000. The total cash flow from operations can be calculated as: Cash from Sales - Cash Dividends - New Machine Purchases + Cash from Sale of Old Machines = $10,000 - $65 - $1,000 + Cash from Sale of Old Machines.

Annual Depreciation = ($45,000 - $5,500) / 5 = $39,500 / 5 = $7,900.
