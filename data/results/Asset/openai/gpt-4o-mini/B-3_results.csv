        On December 31, Strike Company sold one of its batting cages for $55,000. The equipment had an initial cost of $310,000 and has accumulated depreciation of $260,000. Depreciation has been taken up to the end of the year. What is the amount of the gain or loss on this transaction?


        A) $10,000 loss
        B) $5,000 gain
        C) $5,000 loss
        D) $10,000 gain
        ",B-3,D,"To determine the gain or loss on the sale of the batting cage, we first need to calculate the book value of the equipment at the time of sale. The book value is calculated as the initial cost minus accumulated depreciation. In this case, the initial cost is $310,000 and the accumulated depreciation is $260,000. Therefore, the book value is $310,000 - $260,000 = $50,000. The equipment was sold for $55,000, which is $5,000 more than the book value. Thus, the gain on the sale is $55,000 - $50,000 = $5,000. Therefore, the correct answer is B) $5,000 gain.","Plant Assets and Intangibles 483 S9-7 Change in the estimated life of an asset [10 min] Assume that Alpha Communications paid $75,000 for equipment with a 15-year life and zero expected residual value.

This is a fundamental step in accounting for asset sales.\n   - The calculation of the book value is accurately performed: the initial cost of $310,000 minus the accumulated depreciation of $260,000 correctly results in a book value of $50,000.\n   - The final calculation of the gain is also correct, as it correctly identifies that selling the equipment for $55,000 results in a gain of $5,000 over the book value.\n\n2. **Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:**\n   - The initial answer incorrectly identifies the answer choice as D) $10,000 gain, which is not supported by the calculations provided. This indicates a significant error in the final selection of the answer.\n   - The reasoning does not explicitly state that the gain is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the book value, which could lead to confusion for someone less familiar with the concept.\n   - There is no mention of the implications of the gain on financial statements or tax considerations, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the transaction's impact.\n\n3. **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\n   - The answer should clearly state the final answer choice as B) $5,000 gain instead of D) $10,000 gain to align with the calculations provided. This is crucial for clarity and accuracy.\n   - It would be beneficial to explicitly outline the formula used for calculating gain or loss: Gain/Loss = Sale Price - Book Value. This would enhance the clarity of the reasoning.\n   - Including a brief discussion on how this gain would affect the financial statements (e.g., increasing net income) or any potential tax implications would provide a more rounded answer and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic.\n   - The answer could also benefit from a concluding statement that summarizes the findings, reinforcing the correct answer and the reasoning behind it.""}",B,"To determine the gain or loss on the sale of the batting cage, we first need to calculate the book value of the equipment at the time of sale.

How do these two types of businesses differ? How are they similar? The Decision Guidelines answer these questions. and CDs. Businesses that sell a product are called merchandisers because they sell merchandise, or goods, to customers. In this chapter, we’ll introduce accounting for merchandisers, showing how to account for the purchase and sale of inventory, the additional current asset that merchandisers have. Inventory is defined as the merchandise that a company holds for sale to cus- tomers. For example, Greg’s Tunes must hold some CD inventory in order to operate. Walmart carries food inventory in addition to clothing, housewares, and school sup- plies. A Hondadealer holds inventories of automobiles and auto parts. In this chapter, Smart Touch has decided to discontinue its service business and instead plans to sell tutorial CDs and DVDs that it purchases from a vendor. With its change in business strategy, Smart Touch is now considered a merchandiser. By continuing the same company with a different business strategy in the examples, we will give you a basis for comparison between service and merchandising businesses. We’ll also cover examples usin g Greg’s Tunes. Let’s get started by looking at some basics of merchandising operations. What Are Merchandising Operations? Describe and illus- trate merchandising operations and the two types of inven- tory systems 1 Merchandisingconsists of buying and selling products rather than services. Exhibit 5-1 shows how a service entity’s financial statements (on the left) differ from a merchan- diser’s financial statements (on the right). As you can see, merchandisers have some new balance sheet and income statement items.

Income Statement Year Ended June 30, 2013 Merchandising Operations 269 Adjusting and Closing the Accounts of a Merchandiser A merchandiser adjusts and closes accounts the same way a service entity does. If a worksheet is used, the trial balance is entered, and the worksheet is completed to determine net income or net loss. Adjusting Inventory Based on a Physical Count The Inventory account should stay current at all times in a perpetual inventory sys- tem. However, the actual amount of inventory on hand may differ from what the books show. Theft, damage, and errors occur. For this reason, businesses take a physical count of inventory at least once a year. The most common time to count inventory is at the end of the fiscal year. The business then adjusts the Inventory account based on the physical count. Greg’s Tunes’ Inventory account shows an unadjusted balance of $40,500. With no shrinkage—due to theft or error—the business should have inventory costing$ 40,500. But on December 31, Greg’s Tunes counts the inventory on hand, and the total cost comes to only $40,200. Greg’s Tunes records this adjusting entry for inventory shrinkage: Adjust and close the accounts of a mer- chandising business 4 This entry brings Inventory to its correct balance.

Consider the amount of goods a company has available for sale. At the end of the period, the total spent for those items can only appear in two accounts: Inventory (asset) or Cost of goods sold (expense). So what happens to the goods that are miss- ing or damaged? This is considered a cost of doing business and those values are “buried” in the Cost of goods sold amount, rather than shown in a separate account in the ledger.","{'answer': ""### Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning:\n\n1. **Correctness of the Answer**: The initial answer correctly identifies that Merchandise Inventory is classified as a current asset (Option C). This is a fundamental aspect of accounting and is accurate.\n\n2. **Clear Explanation**: The reasoning provided is straightforward and effectively explains why Merchandise Inventory is classified as a current asset. It highlights the relationship between inventory and the operating cycle of a business, which is a key concept in accounting.\n\n3. **Reference to Evidence**: The answer mentions that the classification is supported by evidence from the balance sheet of a merchandising company. This adds credibility to the reasoning, indicating that the answer is not just based on opinion but is grounded in accounting principles.\n\n### Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:\n\n1. **Lack of Depth**: While the answer is correct, it lacks depth in explaining why inventory is considered a current asset. It could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the criteria that define current assets, such as liquidity and the time frame for conversion to cash.\n\n2. **Absence of Context**: The answer does not provide context about the nature of merchandising companies or how inventory functions within different types of businesses. This could help clarify why inventory is specifically categorized as a current asset in this context.\n\n3. **No Mention of Accounting Standards**: The reasoning could be strengthened by referencing relevant accounting standards (e.g., GAAP or IFRS) that dictate the classification of inventory. This would provide a more authoritative basis for the classification.\n\n### Specific Suggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. **Expand on the Definition of Current Assets**: Include a brief explanation of what constitutes current assets, emphasizing the criteria such as liquidity and the expected time frame for conversion to cash. This would enhance the reader's understanding.\n\n2. **Provide Contextual Examples**: Consider adding examples of how different types of businesses (e.g., service vs. merchandising) handle inventory. This would illustrate the importance of inventory in the context of a merchandising company specifically.\n\n3. **Cite Accounting Standards**: Reference relevant accounting standards or principles that support the classification of inventory as a current asset. This could include mentioning the specific sections of GAAP or IFRS that address inventory classification.\n\n4. **Clarify the Role of Inventory in Financial Statements**: Discuss how inventory impacts financial statements beyond just its classification, such as its effect on the cost of goods sold and overall profitability. This would provide a more comprehensive view of its significance in financial reporting.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would not only be correct but also more informative and educational for the reader.""}",C,"Merchandise Inventory is considered a current asset because it is expected to be sold or used up within one year or within the operating cycle of the business.

Next, we calculate total liabilities: Accounts payable ($20,400) + Mortgage payable ($115,000) + Dividends ($8,600) = $144,000. Finally, we subtract total liabilities from total assets: $173,500 - $144,000 = $29,500. Therefore, the net assets would be $29,500, which corresponds to option C, not B.

This step-by-step approach is commendable as it makes the reasoning easy to follow.\n2. **Correct Formula Application**: The answer correctly identifies the formula for calculating net assets (Total Assets - Total Liabilities), which is fundamental in accounting.\n3. **Inclusion of Accumulated Depreciation**: The answer appropriately accounts for accumulated depreciation when calculating total assets, demonstrating an understanding of how depreciation affects asset valuation.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in Logic:\n1. **Incorrect Final Answer**: The answer states that the net assets would be $29,500, which is correct, but it incorrectly identifies the corresponding option as B. The correct option is C. This is a critical error as it misrepresents the final conclusion.\n2. **Misinterpretation of Dividends**: The answer includes dividends as a liability in the total liabilities calculation. However, dividends are typically not considered a liability until declared. This could lead to an inaccurate assessment of total liabilities.\n3. **Lack of Clarification on Dividends**: The reasoning does not clarify the treatment of dividends, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with accounting principles. A brief explanation of why dividends are included or excluded would enhance clarity.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Correct the Final Answer**: Ensure that the final answer corresponds accurately to the calculated net assets. The answer should clearly state that the correct option is C, not B.\n2. **Reassess Liabilities**: Re-evaluate the inclusion of dividends in the liabilities section. If dividends are not declared, they should not be included in the total liabilities. This could significantly change the calculation and the final answer.\n3. **Provide Explanatory Notes**: Include a brief note explaining the treatment of dividends and why accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the equipment cost. This would enhance the educational value of the answer and provide clarity for readers.\n4. **Double-Check Calculations**: It would be beneficial to double-check all calculations and ensure that each component is accurately represented in the final figures. This can help avoid errors in future assessments.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and implementing the suggested improvements, the answer would not only be more accurate but also more informative and educational for the reader.'}",B,"To calculate Net Assets, we need to determine the total assets and total liabilities. Total assets include cash at bank, inventory, accounts receivable, and equipment (cost). Total liabilities include accounts payable and mortgage payable. 

Total Assets = Cash + Inventory + Accounts Receivable + Equipment 
= $27,400 + $22,700 + $16,600 + $124,000 
= $190,700 

Total Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Mortgage Payable 
= $20,400 + $115,000 
= $135,400 

Net Assets = Total Assets - Total Liabilities 
= $190,700 - $135,400 
= $55,300 

However, we need to consider accumulated depreciation, which reduces the value of the equipment. 

Net Assets = $55,300 - $17,200 (accumulated depreciation) 
= $38,100.

For example, you hold them for use in the business— not to sell as inventory. Also, - plant assets are relatively expensive. - the full cost invested in plant assets can be a challenge to determine because of the difficulty of tracking installation, shipping, and other costs related to the asset. - plant assets usually last several years and, as a result, should be allocated over the years they are expected to be used. - plant assets may be sold or traded in. Accounting for the disposal of a plant asset is important because the disposal may create a gain or loss that must be reported on the income statement. As you can see, plant assets pose some accounting challenges. Generally, plant assets can be classified into three main categories: 1. Real or tangible assets. This includes assets whose physical characteristics define their utility or usefulness, such as buildings, desks, and equipment. 2. Natural resources. This includes assets that come from the ground and can ultimately be used up. For example, oil, diamonds, and coal are all natural resource assets. 3. Intangible assets. This includes assets whose value is not derived from their physicality. For example, software programs on a CD are intangible assets. The “physical” CD is not the value—the knowledge/programs on the CD really represent the asset. Exhibit 9-1 shows which expense applies to each category of plant asset. In this chapter, we will conclude our coverage of assets, except for investments. After completing this chapter, you should understand the various plant assets of a business and how to account for them. Along the way, we’ll look at how both Smart Touch Learning and Greg’s Tunes account for their plant assets.

This demonstrates a clear understanding of asset categories.\n   - The reasoning provided is logical and well-structured. It effectively explains the definition of tangible assets, emphasizing their physical characteristics, which is relevant to the classification of a building.\n   - The inclusion of examples (equipment and fixtures) helps to reinforce the definition of tangible assets, providing context for the classification.\n\n2. **Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:**\n   - While the answer correctly identifies the classification, it lacks depth in discussing why a building is not classified as a current asset, intangible asset, or investment. This omission leaves the reasoning somewhat incomplete.\n   - The answer could benefit from a more nuanced discussion of the implications of classifying a building as a tangible asset, such as its impact on financial statements or asset management.\n   - The reasoning does not address potential exceptions or variations in classification based on context (e.g., a building held for sale might be classified differently).\n\n3. **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\n   - Expand the reasoning to include a brief explanation of why a building does not fit into the other categories (current asset, intangible asset, or investment). For example, clarify that a current asset is typically cash or assets expected to be converted to cash within a year, while intangible assets lack physical substance.\n   - Consider discussing the implications of classifying a building as a tangible asset, such as how it affects depreciation, asset valuation, and financial reporting.\n   - Acknowledge any exceptions or special cases where a building might be classified differently, such as in the case of real estate investment trusts (REITs) or properties held for resale, to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of asset classification.\n   - Use more precise language to enhance clarity. For instance, instead of saying ""has physical characteristics that define its utility,"" it could be more effective to say ""has physical characteristics that contribute to its value and utility in business operations."" \n\nBy addressing these points, the answer would not only be correct but also more informative and reflective of a deeper understanding of asset classification.'}",C,"A building is a physical structure that has a measurable value and can be touched, making it a tangible asset.

        Why are some intangible assets amortized and others are not?
        A) Because all intangible assets must be amortized over their legal life
        B) Because finite-lived intangible assets are amortized, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
        C) Because intangible assets with physical substance are amortized, while others are not
        D) Because indefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized, while finite-lived intangible assets are not
        ",B-3,B,"Intangible assets are classified as having either indefinite or definite lives. Definite life intangible assets are amortized over their useful life, while indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized because they do not have a foreseeable limit to the period they are expected to benefit the entity. This distinction is clearly outlined in the provided evidence from IAS 36.","EXHIBIT 15 Summary of IAS 36 - impairment of assets Cash-generating units Under international accounting standards (IAS 36), intangible assets that do not generate independent cash flows on their own are grouped into cash-generating units (CGU). A CGU is the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows, which are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. Goodwill is assigned to a CGU or to a group of CGUs, which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Lifespan of intangible assets Intangible assets are classified as having either indefinite or definite lives. In general, when no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors limit the useful life of an intangible to the enterprise, the use- ful life of an intangible asset is considered to beindefinite. Conversely, definite life intangibles have a foreseeable limit to the period which the asset is expected to benefit the entity. Definite life intangible assets are amortized over their useful life or pattern of expected future benefits. Impairment testing under IAS 36 - assets other than goodwill Definite Life Assets Indefinite Life Assets Impairment Assessment Timing Assessed for circumstances of impairment at each reporting date. Determine the recoverable amount if impairment seems possible. Assessed for impairment any time during an annual period, provided it is performed at the same time every year. Determine the recoverable amount for the asset or CGU. Impairment Test Compare the carrying amount of the asset to the recoverable amount. When the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss exists. Compare the carrying amount of the asset to the recoverable amount. When the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss exists. The recoverable amount is the higher of: a) the fair value less costs to sell,which is the amount that could be obtained from a sale of the asset in an arm’s-length transaction less the costs directly attributable to the sale; or b) the value in use,which is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit. The recoverable amount is the higher of: a) thefair value less costs to sell,which is the amount that could be obtained from a sale of the asset in an arm’s-length transaction less the costs directly attributable to the sale; or b) the value in use,which is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit. Impairment Loss The impairment loss is equal to the carrying amount of the asset or CGU less the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is equal to the carrying amount of the asset or CGU less the recoverable amount. An impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill can be reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was rec- ognized. Under such circumstances, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount; how- ever, the increased carrying amount cannot exceed the original carrying amount (net of any accumulated amortization). 7 Measuring impairment at Dofasco PART 4 ADDITIONAL CASES 609 Copyright 201 Cengage Learning.

Treatment of intangibles such as goodwill can vary widely. Are they amortized or expensed? If amortized, over what period? Such issues can have a large impact on reported profits. The effect of different accounting practices can be substantial. Figure 19.4 compares P/E ratios in different countries as reported and restated on a common basis. While P/E multiples have changed considerably since this study was published, these results illustrate how different accounting rules can have a big impact on these ratios. Some of the differences between U.S. and European accounting standards arise from different philosophies regarding regulating accounting practice. GAAP accounting in the U.S. is rules-based, with detailed, explicit, and lengthy rules governing almost any circum- stance that can be anticipated. In contrast, the international financial reporting standards (IFRS) used in the European Union are principles-based, setting out general approaches for the preparation of financial statements. While EU rules are more flexible, firms must be prepared to demonstrate that their accounting choices are consistent with IFRS principles. IFRS seem on their way to becoming global standards, even outside of the European Union. By 2008, over 100 countries had adopted them, and they are making inroads even in the United States. In November 2007, the SEC began allowing foreign firms to issue securities in the U.S. if their financial statements are prepared using IFRS. In 2008, the SEC went even further when it proposed allowing large U.S. multinational firms to report earnings using IFRS rather than GAAP starting in 2010. A final integration of U.S. rules with IFRS has been long expected but repeatedly delayed. However, even without formal adoption of IFRS, the widespread belief is that the U.S. will continue to change GAAP over time to more closely conform to IFRS rules. The goal is to make cross-border financial statements more consistent and comparable, thereby improving the quality of information available to investors. bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 664bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 664 7/17/13 4:13 PM7/17/13 4:13 PM A-20 Appendix A AMAZON.COM, INC.

This is a fundamental aspect of accounting for intangible assets and is crucial to understanding why some are amortized while others are not.\n   \n2. **Reference to Standards**: The mention of IAS 36 (International Accounting Standard 36) adds credibility to the reasoning. It indicates that the answer is grounded in established accounting principles, which is essential for a robust explanation.\n\n3. **Clarity in Explanation**: The reasoning is articulated clearly, making it easy to understand the rationale behind the amortization of intangible assets. The explanation of why indefinite-lived assets are not amortized is particularly well-stated.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n1. **Misinterpretation of Options**: The answer correctly identifies option B as the right choice, but it does not explicitly address the incorrectness of the other options. For instance, option A is misleading because it suggests that all intangible assets must be amortized, which is not true. Option C incorrectly associates physical substance with amortization, which is irrelevant to the classification of intangible assets. Option D reverses the definitions of finite and indefinite lives, which is a critical error.\n\n2. **Lack of Depth in Explanation**: While the answer provides a basic explanation, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of the implications of these classifications. For example, discussing how the assessment of useful life impacts financial reporting and decision-making could enhance the answer.\n\n3. **No Mention of Impairment Testing**: The answer could be improved by mentioning that indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing rather than amortization. This is an important aspect of accounting for these assets and would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their treatment.\n\n#### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Address All Options**: The answer should explicitly refute the incorrect options (A, C, and D) to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the question. This would strengthen the argument and clarify why option B is the correct choice.\n\n2. **Expand on the Explanation**: Include more details about the implications of classifying intangible assets as finite or indefinite. Discussing the impact on financial statements and the rationale behind the accounting treatment would provide a more thorough understanding.\n\n3. **Incorporate Impairment Testing**: Mention that indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are instead tested for impairment at least annually. This addition would provide a more complete picture of how these assets are managed in accounting practices.\n\n4. **Cite Additional Standards or Guidelines**: If applicable, referencing other relevant accounting standards or guidelines (such as ASC 350 in the U.S. GAAP context) could further bolster the answer and provide a broader context for the treatment of intangible assets.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would not only be more accurate but also more informative and comprehensive.'}",B,"Intangible assets are classified into two categories: finite-lived and indefinite-lived. Finite-lived intangible assets, such as patents or copyrights, have a specific useful life and are amortized over that period. In contrast, indefinite-lived intangible assets, like trademarks or goodwill, do not have a determinable useful life and are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B

        Sloan Company uses its own executive charter plane that originally cost $800,000. It has recorded straight-line depreciation on the plane for six full years, with an $80,000 expected salvage value at the end of its estimated 10-year useful life. Sloan disposes of the plane at the end of the sixth year. What is the (1) accumulated depreciation and (2) net book value of the plane?
        A) Accumulated depreciation: $432,000; Net book value: $368,000
        B) Accumulated depreciation: $432,000; Net book value: $80,000
        C) Accumulated depreciation: $72,000; Net book value: $728,000
        D) Accumulated depreciation: $368,000; Net book value: $432,000
        ",B-3,A,"To calculate the accumulated depreciation for the plane, we first determine the annual depreciation expense. The cost of the plane is $800,000, and the salvage value is $80,000, giving a depreciable base of $800,000 - $80,000 = $720,000. The useful life is 10 years, so the annual depreciation expense is $720,000 / 10 = $72,000. After 6 years, the accumulated depreciation would be 6 years * $72,000/year = $432,000. The net book value is calculated as the original cost minus accumulated depreciation: $800,000 - $432,000 = $368,000. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Accumulated depreciation: $432,000; Net book value: $368,000.","E (millions unless otherwise noted) Aircraft cost, 1/1/2011 E21,699 Reported Depreciable cost E18,444.15 Cost /C2 (1 /C0 0.15) Accumulated depreciation, 1/1/2011 E11,699 Reported Accumulated depreciation/Depreciable cost 63.43% Depreciable life 12 years Reported Average age of aircraft 7.612 years 12 /C2 0.6343 years If Lufthansa used the same life and salvage estimates as BA, the annual depreciation rate would have been 4.5 percent, implying that given the average age of its fleet, accumulated depreciation would have been E7,433 (7.612 /C2 0.045 /C2 21,699) versus the reported E11,699. Consequently, the company’s Non-Current Tangible Assets would have increased by E4,266 (11,699 /C0 7,433). 2 Calculate the offsetting increase in equity (retained earnings) and in the deferred tax liability. Given the 25 per- cent marginal tax rate, the adjustment to Non-Current Tangible Assets would have required offsetting adjust- ments ofE1,066 (0.25 /C2 4,266) to the Deferred Tax Liability and E3,200 (0.75 /C2 4,266) to Shareholders’ Equity. 3 Reduce the depreciation expense (and increase the book value of the fleet) to reflect the lower depreciation for the current year. Assuming thatE1,215 million net new aircraft purchased in 2011 were acquired throughout the year, and therefore require only half a year of depreciation, the depreciation expense for 2011 (included in Cost of Sales) would have beenE1,004 million {0.045 /C2 [21,699 þ (1,215/2)]} versus the E1,580 {(0.85/12) /C2 [21,699 þ (1,215/2)]} million reported by the company. Thus Cost of Sales would decline by E576 million. 4 Increase the tax expense, net profit, and the balance sheet values of equity and the deferred tax liability. Given the 25 percent tax rate for 2011, the Tax Expense for the year would increase byE144 million. On the balance sheet, these changes would increase Non-Current Tangible Assets by E576 million, increase Deferred Tax Liability by E144 million, and increase Shareholders’ Equity byE432 million. Note that these changes are designed to show Lufthansa’s results as if it had always used the same depreciation assumptions as BA rather than to reflect a change in the assumptions for the current year going forward. This enables the analyst to be able to compare ratios that use assets (e.g., return on assets) for the two companies. By making the adjustments, the analyst substantially improves the comparability of Lufthansa’s and BA’s financial statements. In summary, if Lufthansa were using the same depreciation method as BA, its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 would have to be modified as follows (references to the above described steps are reported in brackets): Adjustments December 31, 2010 Adjustments December 31, 2011 E (millions) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Balance sheet Non-Current Tangible Assets þ4,266 (1) þ4,266 (1) þ576 (3) Deferred Tax Liability þ1,066 (2) þ1,066 (2) þ144 (4) Shareholders’ Equity þ3,200 (2) þ3,200 (2) þ432 (4) Income statement Cost of Sales /C0 576 (3) Tax Expense þ144 (4) Net Profit þ432 (4) 142 PART 2 BUSINESS ANALYSIS AND VALUATION TOOLS Copyright 201 Cengage Learning.

Another asset measurement issue is whether to use the gross book value of assets (the historical cost of the assets), or the net book value of assets (historical cost less accumulated depreciation). Many firms will use the net book value of assets because the figure is consistent with and easily pulled from the balance sheet. Because depre- ciation expense factors into the firm’s operating income, the net book value concept is also consistent with the measurement of operating income. However, using the net book value of assets has a definite drawback. Over time, the net book value of assets decreases because accumulated depreciation continues to grow until the assets are fully depreciated. Therefore, ROI, RI, and EVA get larger over time simply because of depreciation rather than from actual improvements in operations. In addition, the rate of this depreciation effect will depend on the depreciation method used. In general, calculating ROI based on the net book value of assets gives managers incentive to continue using old, outdated equipment because its low net book value results in a higher ROI. However, top management may want the division to invest in new technology to create operational efficiency (internal business perspective of the balanced scorecard) or to enhance its information systems (learning and growth per- spective). The long-term effects of using outdated equipment may be devastating, as competitors use new technology to produce and sell at lower cost. Therefore, to cre- ategoal congruence, some firms prefer calculating ROI based on the gross book value of assets. The same general rule holds true for RI and EVA calculations—All else being equal, using net book value will increase RI and EVA over time. Short-Term Focus One serious drawback of financial performance measures is their short-term focus. Companies usually prepare performance reports and calculate ROI, RI, and EVA figures over a one-year time frame or less. If upper management uses a short time frame, division managers have an incentive to take actions that will lead to an immediate increase in these measures, even if such actions may not be in the com- pany’s long-term interest (such as cutting back on R&D or advertising). On the other hand, some potentially positive actions considered by subunit managers may take longer than one year to generate income at the targeted level. Many product life cycles start slow, even incurring losses in the early stages, before generating profit. If managers are measured on short-term financial performance only, they may not introduce new products because they are not willing to wait several years for the positive effect to show up in their financial performance measures. As a potential remedy, management can measure financial performance using a longer time horizon, such as three to five years. Extending the time frame gives sub- unit managers the incentive to think long term rather than short term and make decisions that will positively impact the company over the next several years. The limitations of financial performance measures confirm the importance of the balanced scorecard. The deficiencies of financial measures can be overcome by taking a broader view of performance—including KPIs from all four balanced score- card perspectives rather than concentrating on only the financial measures. Next, take some time to review the Decision Guidelines and Summary Problem on the next s. To evaluate an investment center’s financial performance, companies need summary performance measures—or KPIs—that include both the division’s operating income and its assets. Commonly used KPIs for evaluating an investment center’s financial performance are return on investment (ROI), residual income (RI), and economic value added (EVA). Each of these financial KPIs must be considered in conjunction with KPIs that come from all four of the balanced scorecard perspectives. Key Takeaway Plant Assets and Intangibles 481 5.

After the land is ready for use, will these costs be capitalized or expensed? 1","{'answer': '1. **Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning:**\n   - The answer correctly identifies the method for calculating accumulated depreciation using the straight-line method, which is appropriate given the context of the question.\n   - The calculation of the depreciable base is accurate, as it correctly subtracts the salvage value from the original cost of the plane.\n   - The annual depreciation expense is calculated correctly, and the multiplication to find the accumulated depreciation over six years is also accurate.\n   - The final calculation of the net book value is logically derived from the accumulated depreciation and the original cost, leading to a coherent conclusion.\n\n2. **Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:**\n   - While the calculations are correct, the answer does not explicitly state the formula used for the net book value calculation, which could enhance clarity for readers who may not be familiar with the terminology.\n   - The answer could benefit from a brief explanation of what accumulated depreciation and net book value represent in the context of asset management, as this would provide additional context for the reader.\n   - The answer does not address the implications of disposing of the asset, such as potential gains or losses on disposal, which could be relevant in a broader discussion about asset management.\n\n3. **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\n   - Include a brief explanation of the terms ""accumulated depreciation"" and ""net book value"" to provide context for readers who may not be familiar with these concepts.\n   - Clearly state the formula for net book value (Net Book Value = Original Cost - Accumulated Depreciation) to enhance clarity and reinforce the logical flow of the calculations.\n   - Consider discussing the implications of the disposal of the asset, such as how it might affect financial statements or tax considerations, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n   - It may also be beneficial to mention any assumptions made in the calculations, such as the consistency of the straight-line method over the asset\'s useful life, to strengthen the reasoning further.'}",A,"To calculate the accumulated depreciation and net book value of the plane, we first determine the annual depreciation expense. The formula for straight-line depreciation is: (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life. Here, the cost is $800,000, the salvage value is $80,000, and the useful life is 10 years. Thus, the annual depreciation expense is ($800,000 - $80,000) / 10 = $72,000. Over six years, the accumulated depreciation would be 6 years * $72,000/year = $432,000. The net book value at the end of six years is the original cost minus accumulated depreciation: $800,000 - $432,000 = $368,000. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Accumulated depreciation: $432,000; Net book value: $368,000.",A

        D) $274,000.00
        ",B-3,D,"To find the total assets of the company at December 31, 2009, we can use the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. First, we need to calculate the equity at the end of 2009. Starting with the equity at the end of 2008, which is $146,000, we add the net income for 2009. The net income is calculated as Revenues - Expenses = $210,000 - $179,000 = $31,000. Therefore, the equity at the end of 2009 is $146,000 + $31,000 = $177,000. Now, we can calculate total assets: Total Assets = Liabilities + Equity = $97,000 + $177,000 = $274,000. Thus, the correct answer is D) $274,000.00.","Requirements 1.

We see this in the fact that stock prices tend to increase when firms announce earnings greater than market analysts or investors had anticipated. The Balance Sheet While the income statement provides a measure of profitability over a period of time, the balance sheet provides a “snapshot” of the financial condition of the firm at a particular moment. The balance sheet is a list of the firm’s assets and liabilities at that moment. The difference in assets and liabilities is the net worth of the firm, also called shareholders’ or stockholders’ equity. Like income statements, balance sheets are reasonably standardized in presentation. Table 19.2 is HD’s balance sheet. The first section of the balance sheet gives a listing of the assets of the firm. Current assets are presented first. These are cash and other items such as accounts receivable or inventories that will be converted into cash within 1 year. Next comes a listing of long-term or “fixed” assets. Tangible fixed assets are items such as buildings, equipment, or vehicles. HD also has several intangible assets such as a respected brand name and expertise. But accountants generally are reluctant to include these assets on the balance sheet, as they are so hard to value. However, when one firm purchases another for a premium over its book value, that difference, called “goodwill,” is listed on the balance sheet as an intangible fixed asset. HD lists goodwill at $1,120 million. 1 The sum of current and fixed assets is total assets, the last line of the assets section of the balance sheet. The liability and shareholders’ equity (also called stockholders’ equity) section is arranged similarly. First come short-term, or “current,” liabilities such as accounts pay- able, accrued taxes, and debts that are due within 1 year. Following this is long-term debt and other liabilities due in more than 1 year. The difference between total assets and total liabilities is stockholders’ equity. This is the net worth, or book value, of the firm. Stock- holders’ equity is divided into par value of stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, although this division is usually unimportant. Briefly, par value plus additional paid-in capital represent the proceeds realized from the sale of stock to the public, whereas retained earnings represent the buildup of equity from profits plowed back into the firm. Even if the firm issues no new equity, book value typically will increase each year due to reinvested earnings. The entries in the left columns of the balance sheet in Table 19.2 present the dollar value of each asset. Just as they compute common-size income statements, however, ana- lysts also find it convenient to use common-size balance sheets when comparing firms of different sizes. Each item is expressed as a percentage of total assets. These entries appear in the right columns of Table 19.2 . The Statement of Cash Flows The income statement and balance sheets are based on accrual methods of accounting, which means that revenues and expenses are recognized at the time of a sale even if no cash has yet been exchanged. In contrast, the statement of cash flows tracks the cash 1 Firms are required to test their goodwill assets for “impairment” each year. If the value of the acquired firm is clearly less than its purchase price, that amount must be charged off as an expense. For example, in 2012 Hewlett- Packard wrote off $8.8 billion on its earlier purchase of the software company Autonomy Corp. amid charges that Autonomy had overstated its profitability prior to the purchase. AOL Time Warner set a record when it recognized an impairment of $99 billion in 2002 following the January 2001 merger of Time Warner with AOL. bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 637bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 637 7/17/13 4:12 PM7/17/13 4:12 PM E15-15 Vertical analysis of a balance sheet [10-15 min] Beta Graphics, Inc., has the following data: 2 Balance sheet: Cash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

This is explicitly stated in the provided text, which defines book value as the net amount (cost minus accumulated depreciation) of a plant asset.","CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 593 its assets. Shareholders’ equity is this net worth. However, the values of both assets and liabilities recognized in financial statements are based on historical—not current—values. For example, the book value of an asset equals the original cost of acquisition less some adjustment for depreciation, even if the market price of that asset has changed over time. Moreover, depreciation allowances are used to allocate the original cost of the asset over several years, but do not reflect loss of actual value. Whereas book values are based on original cost, market values measure current values of assets and liabilities. The market value of the shareholders’ equity investment equals the difference between the current values of all assets and liabilities. We’ve emphasized that current values generally will not match historical ones. Equally or even more important, many assets, such as the value of a good brand name or specialized expertise developed over many years, may not even be included on the financial statements. Market prices therefore reflect the value of the firm as a going concern. It would be unusual if the market price of a stock were exactly equal to its book value. Can book value represent a “floor” for the stock’s price, below which level the market price can never fall? Although Microsoft’s book value per share in 2012 was less than its market price, other evidence disproves this notion. While it is not common, there are always some firms selling at a market price below book value. In 2012, for example, such troubled firms included Sprint/Nextel, Bank of America, Mitsubishi, and AOL. A better measure of a floor for the stock price is the firm’s liquidation value per share. This represents the amount of money that could be realized by breaking up the firm, selling its assets, repaying its debt, and distributing the remainder to the shareholders. If the mar- ket price of equity drops below liquidation value, the firm becomes attractive as a takeover target. A corporate raider would find it profitable to buy enough shares to gain control and then actually to liquidate. Another measure of firm value is the replacement cost of assets less liabilities. Some analysts believe the market value of the firm cannot remain for long too far above its replacement cost because if it did, competitors would enter the market. The resulting com- petitive pressure would drive down the market value of all firms until they fell to replace- ment cost. This idea is popular among economists, and the ratio of market price to replacement cost is known as Tobin’s q, after the Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin. In the long run, according to this view, the ratio of market price to replacement cost will tend toward 1, but the evidence is that this ratio can differ significantly from 1 for very long periods. Although focusing on the balance sheet can give some useful information about a firm’s liquidation value or its replacement cost, the analyst must usually turn to expected future cash flows for a better estimate of the firm’s value as a going concern. We therefore turn to the quantitative models that analysts use to value common stock based on forecasts of future earnings and dividends. 18.2 Intrinsic Value versus Market Price The most popular model for assessing the value of a firm as a going concern starts from the observation that an investor in stock expects a return consisting of cash dividends and capital gains or losses. We begin by assuming a 1-year holding period and supposing that ABC stock has an expected dividend per share, E ( D 1 ), of $4; the current price of a share, P 0 , is $48; and the expected price at the end of a year, E ( P 1 ), is $52. For now, don’t worry about how you derive your forecast of next year’s price. At this point we ask only whether the stock seems attractively priced today given your forecast of next year’s price. bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd 593bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd 593 7/17/13 4:08 PM7/17/13 4:08 PM Another asset measurement issue is whether to use the gross book value of assets (the historical cost of the assets), or the net book value of assets (historical cost less accumulated depreciation). Many firms will use the net book value of assets because the figure is consistent with and easily pulled from the balance sheet. Because depre- ciation expense factors into the firm’s operating income, the net book value concept is also consistent with the measurement of operating income. However, using the net book value of assets has a definite drawback. Over time, the net book value of assets decreases because accumulated depreciation continues to grow until the assets are fully depreciated. Therefore, ROI, RI, and EVA get larger over time simply because of depreciation rather than from actual improvements in operations. In addition, the rate of this depreciation effect will depend on the depreciation method used. In general, calculating ROI based on the net book value of assets gives managers incentive to continue using old, outdated equipment because its low net book value results in a higher ROI. However, top management may want the division to invest in new technology to create operational efficiency (internal business perspective of the balanced scorecard) or to enhance its information systems (learning and growth per- spective). The long-term effects of using outdated equipment may be devastating, as competitors use new technology to produce and sell at lower cost. Therefore, to cre- ategoal congruence, some firms prefer calculating ROI based on the gross book value of assets. The same general rule holds true for RI and EVA calculations—All else being equal, using net book value will increase RI and EVA over time. Short-Term Focus One serious drawback of financial performance measures is their short-term focus. Companies usually prepare performance reports and calculate ROI, RI, and EVA figures over a one-year time frame or less. If upper management uses a short time frame, division managers have an incentive to take actions that will lead to an immediate increase in these measures, even if such actions may not be in the com- pany’s long-term interest (such as cutting back on R&D or advertising). On the other hand, some potentially positive actions considered by subunit managers may take longer than one year to generate income at the targeted level. Many product life cycles start slow, even incurring losses in the early stages, before generating profit. If managers are measured on short-term financial performance only, they may not introduce new products because they are not willing to wait several years for the positive effect to show up in their financial performance measures. As a potential remedy, management can measure financial performance using a longer time horizon, such as three to five years. Extending the time frame gives sub- unit managers the incentive to think long term rather than short term and make decisions that will positively impact the company over the next several years. The limitations of financial performance measures confirm the importance of the balanced scorecard. The deficiencies of financial measures can be overcome by taking a broader view of performance—including KPIs from all four balanced score- card perspectives rather than concentrating on only the financial measures. Next, take some time to review the Decision Guidelines and Summary Problem on the next s. To evaluate an investment center’s financial performance, companies need summary performance measures—or KPIs—that include both the division’s operating income and its assets. Commonly used KPIs for evaluating an investment center’s financial performance are return on investment (ROI), residual income (RI), and economic value added (EVA). Each of these financial KPIs must be considered in conjunction with KPIs that come from all four of the balanced scorecard perspectives.

The term accrued expenserefers to an expense of this type. An accrued expense hasn’t been paid for yet. Consider an employee’s salary. The salary expense grows as the employee works, so the expense is said to accrue. Another accrued expense is interest expense on a note payable. Interest accrues as time passes on the note. An accrued expense always creates a liability. Companies do not make weekly journal entries to accrue expenses. Instead, they wait until the end of the period. They make an adjustin g entry to bring each expense (and the related liability) up-to-date for the financial statements.

This demonstrates a clear understanding of the accounting terminology involved.\n2. **Reference to Text**: The reasoning mentions that the definition is explicitly stated in the provided text. This indicates that the answer is based on a reliable source, which strengthens the credibility of the response.\n\n#### Weaknesses and Gaps:\n1. **Lack of Contextual Explanation**: While the answer correctly identifies the term, it does not provide any additional context or explanation about why ""book value"" is the correct term. This could leave readers who are unfamiliar with the concept without a deeper understanding.\n2. **Absence of Comparison**: The reasoning does not address why the other options (market value, fair value, real value) are incorrect. A brief explanation of these terms in relation to book value would enhance the answer by providing a clearer distinction between them.\n3. **Over-reliance on Text**: The statement that the definition is ""explicitly stated in the provided text"" is vague. It would be more effective to paraphrase or summarize the relevant part of the text to reinforce the reasoning rather than relying solely on the text\'s authority.\n\n#### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Expand on the Definition**: Include a brief explanation of what ""book value"" means in practical terms, such as its significance in financial reporting and asset valuation.\n2. **Compare with Other Options**: Provide a short comparison of the other answer choices. For example, explain that market value refers to the price at which an asset could be sold in the market, while fair value is a more subjective measure that considers various factors beyond just cost and depreciation.\n3. **Clarify Text Reference**: Instead of simply stating that the definition is in the text, it would be beneficial to summarize the relevant section or provide a direct quote. This would strengthen the argument and provide clarity to the reader.\n4. **Use of Examples**: Incorporating a simple example of how to calculate book value could help illustrate the concept more effectively, making it easier for readers to grasp the idea.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would not only be correct but also more informative and engaging for the reader.'}",C,"The difference between an asset's cost and its accumulated depreciation is known as the book value of the asset.

Balance Sheet March 31, 2014 The operating budget is the set of budgets that project sales revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses, leading to the budgeted income statement that projects operating income for the period. The first component of the operating bud- get is the sales budget, the cornerstone of the master budget. Why? Because sales affect most other components of the master budget. After projecting sales revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses, management prepares the end result of the operating budget: the budgeted income statement that projects operating income for the period. The second type of budget is the capital expenditures budget. This budget pre- sents the company’s plan for purchasing property, plant, equipment, and other long- term assets. The third type of budget is the financial budget. Prior components of the mas- ter budget, including the budgeted income statement and the capital expenditures budget, along with plans for raising cash and paying debts, provide information for the first element of the financial budget: the cash budget. The cash budgetdetails how the business expects to go from the beginning cash balance to the desired end- ing cash balance and feeds into the budgeted balance sheet, which, in turn, feeds into the budgeted statement of cash flows. These budgeted financial statements look exactly like ordinary statements. The only difference is that they list budgeted (pro- jected) amounts rather than actual amounts. Data for Greg’s Tunes In this chapter, we will use Greg’s Tunes to see how managers prepare operating and financial budgets. Chapter 21 explained the capital budgeting process. Here is the information you have. We will refer back to this information as we create the oper- ating and financial budgets. 1.

While the total assets are calculated correctly, the question implies that total assets should be reported net of accumulated depreciation. This oversight could lead to confusion regarding the correct interpretation of total assets.\n   - **Lack of Explanation for the Choice:** The reasoning does not explain why the total assets are reported as $2,473 million without considering accumulated depreciation. This could mislead readers into thinking that the total assets are simply the sum of the asset accounts without any adjustments.\n\n3. **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\n   - **Incorporate Accumulated Depreciation:** The answer should explicitly state that accumulated depreciation ($79 million) must be subtracted from the total of the building and equipment to arrive at the net asset value. This would clarify the calculation and align it with standard accounting practices.\n   - **Provide a Detailed Calculation:** Instead of just stating the total, the answer could benefit from a breakdown of the calculation, showing the total assets before and after accounting for accumulated depreciation. For example, it could state: ""Total assets before depreciation = $2,473 million; less accumulated depreciation = $79 million; therefore, total assets = $2,394 million.""\n   - **Clarify the Answer Choice:** The answer should explicitly indicate that the correct choice is A) $2,394 million, as this reflects the total assets net of accumulated depreciation. This would ensure that the conclusion is not only correct but also clearly justified based on the calculations provided.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would be more accurate, comprehensive, and aligned with accounting principles.'}",B,"To calculate total assets, we sum all the debit balances listed under assets.

        Distinguish between Current and Non-Current Assets, giving four examples of each.
        A) Current assets are liquidated within a year, while non-current assets are held for more than a year. Examples:

Current Assets: Cash, inventory, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses.
Non-Current Assets: Equipment, land, copyrights, patents.
        B) Current assets are tangible, while non-current assets are intangible. Examples:

Current Assets: Cash, machinery, buildings, inventory.
Non-Current Assets: Patents, trademarks, prepaid rent, accounts receivable.
        C) Current assets depreciate over time, while non-current assets do not. Examples:

Current Assets: Inventory, accounts receivable, cash, notes payable.
Non-Current Assets: Land, copyrights, accounts payable, machinery.
        D) Current assets are resources purchased for long-term operations, while non-current assets are for short-term needs. Examples:

Current Assets: Equipment, land, cash, inventory.
Non-Current Assets: Prepaid expenses, patents, accounts receivable, trademarks.

Completing the Accounting Cycle 211 Current Assets Current assets will be converted to cash, sold, or used up during the next 12 months, or within the business’s operating cycle if the cycle is longer than a year. Current assets are items that will be used up in a year, like your notebook paper for this class or the change in your pocket. The operating cycle is the time span when 1. cash is used to acquire goods and services, 2. these goods and services are sold to customers, and 3. the business collects cash from customers. For most businesses, the operating cycle is a few months. Cash, Accounts receivable, Supplies, and Prepaid expenses are current assets. Merchandising entities such as Lowes and Coca-Cola have another current asset: inventory. Inventory shows the cost of the goods the company holds for sale to customers, like tools at Lowesor cans of soda for Coca-Cola. Long-Term Assets Long-term assets are all the assets that will not be converted to cash within the busi- ness’s operating cycle. Long-term assets can be used for more than a year, like your car or computer. One category of long-term assets is plant assets (also called fixed assets or property, plant, and equipment). Land, Buildings, Furniture, and Equipment are plant assets. Of these, Smart Touch has Furniture and a Building. Other categories of long-term assets include Long-Term Investments and Other Assets (a catchall category). We will discuss these categories in later chapters. Liabilities Owners need to know when they must pay each liability. The balance sheet lists lia- bilities in the order in which they must be paid. Balance sheets report two liability categories:current liabilities and long-term liabilities. Current Liabilities Current liabilities must be paid either with cash or with goods and services within one year, or within the entity’s operating cycle if the cycle is longer than a year. Your cell phone bill is a current liability because you have to pay it every month. Accounts payable, Notes payable due within one year, Salary payable, Interest payable, and Unearned revenue are all current liabilities. Long-Term Liabilities All liabilities that do not need to be paid within the entity’s operating cycle are clas- sified as long-term liabilities. When you buy a car, you often sign up for several years of car payments, making it a long-term liability. Many notes payable are long-term, such as a mortgage on a building. The Classified Balance Sheet So far we have presented the unclassified balance sheet of Smart Touch. We are now ready for the balance sheet that is actually used in practice—called a classified balance sheet. Exhibit 4-12 presents Smart Touch classified balance sheet using the data from Exhibit 4-7 on 205. Smart Touch classifies each asset and each liability as either current or long- term. Notice that the Total assets of $75,500 is the same as the Total assets on the unclassified balance sheet in Exhibit 4-7. The classification of assets and liabilities as current or long- term affects many key ratios that outsiders use to evaluate the financial health of a company. Many times, the classification of a particular account is very clear—for example, a building is normally a long-term asset. But what if the company must demolish the existing building within six months due to some structural default? It would not be ethical to still show the building as a long-term asset. Connect To: Ethics The asset received is valued at either 1) fair value of the asset given up or 2) fair value of the asset received plus/minus cash received/paid. Also called a non-monetary exchange. Natural Resources (p. 472) Plant assets that come from the earth. Natural resources are like inventories in the ground (oil) or on top of the ground (timber). Net Book Value (p. 466) Original cost of the asset less total accu- mulated depreciation taken on the asset. Non-Monetary Exchange (p. 468) Trading an asset for another asset that has similar functionality. The asset r eceived is valued at either 1) fair value of the asset given up or 2) fair value of the asset received plus/minus cash received/paid. Also called a like-kind exchange. Obsolete (p. 459) An asset is considered obsolete when a newer asset can perform the job more effi- ciently than the old. Ordinary Repairs (p. 457) Repair work that is debited to an expense account. Patent (p. 473) An intangible asset that is a federal government grant conveying an exclusive 20-year right to produce and sell a process or formula. Real Assets (p. 453) Assets with physical form.

It correctly states that current assets are liquidated within a year, while non-current assets are held for more than a year. This is a fundamental distinction in accounting and is essential for understanding asset classification.\n\n2. **Appropriate Examples**: The examples provided for both current and non-current assets in Option A are relevant and commonly accepted in accounting practices. Cash, inventory, accounts receivable, and prepaid expenses are indeed classified as current assets, while equipment, land, copyrights, and patents are typically considered non-current assets.\n\n3. **Clarity**: The reasoning is clear and straightforward, making it easy for readers to understand the distinctions between the two types of assets.\n\n#### Weaknesses:\n1. **Lack of Depth**: While the definitions and examples are correct, the answer lacks depth in explaining why these classifications matter. It would benefit from a brief discussion on the implications of asset classification for financial reporting and liquidity management.\n\n2. **Inadequate Comparison**: The answer does not address the other options (B, C, D) that were presented in the question. A more comprehensive critique would involve comparing Option A to the other options to justify why it is the best choice.\n\n3. **Misleading Information in Other Options**: The answer does not point out the inaccuracies in the other options. For instance, Option B incorrectly states that current assets are tangible, which is misleading since accounts receivable are intangible. Highlighting these inaccuracies would strengthen the critique of Option A.\n\n4. **Examples in Other Options**: Some examples in the other options are incorrect or misleading. For example, Option C lists ""notes payable"" and ""accounts payable"" as current assets, which are liabilities, not assets. This should be addressed to provide a more thorough evaluation.\n\n#### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Expand on Importance**: Include a brief explanation of why distinguishing between current and non-current assets is important for financial analysis, such as its impact on liquidity ratios and financial health assessments.\n\n2. **Compare and Contrast**: Provide a comparison of Option A with the other options to highlight why it is the most accurate. This would involve identifying specific inaccuracies or misleading statements in the other options.\n\n3. **Clarify Misleading Examples**: Point out the inaccuracies in the examples provided in the other options, particularly in B and C, to reinforce the correctness of Option A.\n\n4. **Consider Broader Context**: Discuss how the classification of assets can affect business decisions, such as investment strategies or cash flow management, to provide a more holistic view of the topic.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would not only be more robust but also provide a deeper understanding of the topic at hand.'}",A,"Option A correctly defines current assets as those that are expected to be liquidated or converted into cash within one year, while non-current assets are held for longer than a year.

We don ’t care about the gain itself, we need to know the amount of cash received from the sale. Remember, we are looking for cash movement. How much cash did the business receive from the sale of plant assets? First, let’s look at the cost of the sold assets. This will be the missing value in our Plant assets, net T-account. So our completed T-account is as follows: Cash received from selling plant assets can be computed by using the journal entry approach: 12/31/13 Bal + Acquisitions - Depreciation - COSA? = 12/31/14 Bal 210,000 310,000+ - 20,000 - COSA? = 460,000 500,000 - COSA? = 460,000 = 40,000COSA?

Depreciation (from Inc Stmt) Cost of sold assets (COSA) 210,000 310,000 460,000 12/31/13 Bal Acquisitions 12/31/14 Bal B E Computing Acquisitions and Sales of Plant Assets Companies keep a separate account for each asset, but for computing investing cash flows, it is helpful to combine all the plant assets into a single Plant assets account. We subtract accumulated depreciation from the assets’ cost in order to work with a single net figure for plant assets, such as P lant assets, net—$ 460,000. This simplifies the computations. Recall that Asset cost minus accumulated depreciation equals the book value of the asset. So the Plant assets, net account holds the book value of plant assets. To illustrate, observe that Smart Touch’s - balance sheet reports plant assets, net of depreciation, of $460,000 at the end of 2014 and $210,000 at the end of 2013 (Exhibit 14-5). - income statement shows depreciation expense of $20,000 and a $10,000 gain on sale of plant assets (Exhibit 14-6). Also, assume that Smart Touch ’s acquisitions of plant assets durin g 2014 totaled $310,000. This gives us an incomplete T-account as follows: E The $40,000 book-value comes from the Plant assets (Net) account on the bal- ance sheet. The gain or loss comes from the income statement. The missing amount must be the cash received from the sale. So, we compute the cash receipt from the sale as follows: Plant Assets and Intangibles 469 Truck 41,000 Accumulated depreciation—truck 16,000 b. If the asset was traded in a non-like kind manner or the fair value of either the asset received or given up is known, then the net difference will represent gain or loss on the disposal (or sale) of the disposed asset. Record the gain or loss to the income statement as follows: - If the total debits > total credits—a credit entry will be made to make the journal entry balance. The credit represents a Gain on sale (or disposal) of an asset. - If the total debits < total credits—a debit entry will be made to make the journal entry balance. The debit represents a Loss on sale (or disposal) of an asset. - If total debits = total credits—there is no Gain or Loss on sale (or dis- posal) of the asset. To apply this, let ’s consider the truck Gre g’s Tunes purchased on January 1, 2011. Assume the business recorded depreciation using the straig ht-line method throug h December 31, 2012. Accordin g to Exhibit 9-6 presented earlier in the chapter, Greg’s Tunes’ historical cost of the truck was $41,000, $1,000 was the estimated residual value, and $ 16,000 has been recorded in total accumulated depreciation throu gh 12/31/2012. Before we consider any transactions, the T-accounts would appear as follows: To illustrate accounting for disposal of an asset, let ’s consider the five options that Greg’s Tunes has to dispose of the truck. All options are assumed to take place on March 31, 2013. Separate exhibits illustrate each of the five options. 1. Situation A - The truck is in an accident and is totaled. The truck is completely worthless and must be scrapped for $0. There are no insurance proceeds from the accident. 2. Situation B - Greg’s Tunes sells the truck to Bob’s Burger House for $10,000 cash. 3. Situation C - Greg’ s Tunes sells the truck to Harry’ s Hot Dogs. Harry’ s gives Greg’s $20,000 cash and a piece of equipment worth $5,000 for the truck. 4. Situation D - Greg’s Tunes trades the old truck in for a new Toyotatruck. The fair market value of the Toyota truck is $32,000. 5. Situation E - Greg’s Tunes trades the old truck and $3,000 in cash for a Toyota truck. The fair value of neither the old or the new truck is known. Situation A—Scrap the Truck If assets are junked before they are fully depreciated, there is a loss equal to the asset’s book value. Let ’s apply the four steps for disposal outlined previously to demonstrate this: STEP 1: Bring the depreciation up to date. Depreciation has not been taken on the truck since December 31, 2012. It is now March 31, 2013, so three months have passed and we need to record three months of depreciation. The problem stated earlier that Greg’s is using the straig ht-line method, so we calculate depreciation for the three months and journalize. STEP 2: Remove the old, disposed of asset from the books. To remove the asset, we must zero out both the asset and Accumulated depreciation accounts. (Note that the entry is incomplete at this point because we must record what we have received, if anything, in the next step.) CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 639 implications of transactions. For example, if goods are sold now, with payment due in 60 days, the income statement will treat the revenue as generated when the sale occurs, and the balance sheet will be immediately augmented by accounts receivable, but the statement of cash flows will not show an increase in available cash until the bill is paid. Table 19.3 is the statement of cash flows for HD. The first entry listed under cash provided by operations is net income. The next entries modify that figure for components of income that have been recognized but for which cash has not yet changed hands. For example, HD’s accounts receivable increased by $170 million. This portion of sales was claimed on the income statement, but the cash had not yet been collected. Increases in accounts receivable are in effect an investment in working capital, and therefore reduce the cash flows realized from operations. Similarly, increases in accounts payable mean that expenses have been recognized, but cash has not yet left the firm. Any payment delay increases the company’s net cash flows in this period. Another major difference between the income statement and the statement of cash flows involves depreciation, which is a major addition to income in the adjustment section of the statement of cash flows in Table 19.3 . The income statement attempts to “smooth” large capital expenditures over time. The depreciation expense on the income statement does this by recognizing such expenditures over a period of many years rather than at the specific time of purchase. In contrast, the statement of cash flows recognizes the cash implication of a capital expenditure when it occurs. Therefore, it adds back the depreciation “expense” Source: Home Depot Annual Report, year ending January 2012. $ Million Cash provided by operations Net income $ 3,883 Adjustments to net income Depreciation 1,682 Changes in working capital Decrease (increase) in receivables (170) Decrease (increase) in inventories 256 Increase (decrease) in other current liabilities 405 Changes due to other operating activities 595 Total adjustments $ 2,768 Cash provided by operations 6,651 Cash flows from investments Gross investment in tangible fixed assets $(1,221) Investments in other assets 92 Cash provided by (used for) investments $(1,129) Cash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities Additions to (reductions in) long-term debt $ 966 Net issues (repurchases of) shares (3,164) Dividends (1,632) Other (218) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $(4,048) Net increase in cash $ 1,474 Table 19.3 Statement of cash flows for Home Depot bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 639bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 639 7/17/13 4:12 PM7/17/13 4:12 PM","{'answer': '### Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning\n\n1. **Correct Identification of the Concept**: The answer correctly identifies that gains on the cash sales of fixed assets are determined by the excess of cash proceeds over the book value.

For example, you hold them for use in the business— not to sell as inventory. Also, - plant assets are relatively expensive. - the full cost invested in plant assets can be a challenge to determine because of the difficulty of tracking installation, shipping, and other costs related to the asset. - plant assets usually last several years and, as a result, should be allocated over the years they are expected to be used. - plant assets may be sold or traded in. Accounting for the disposal of a plant asset is important because the disposal may create a gain or loss that must be reported on the income statement. As you can see, plant assets pose some accounting challenges. Generally, plant assets can be classified into three main categories: 1. Real or tangible assets. This includes assets whose physical characteristics define their utility or usefulness, such as buildings, desks, and equipment. 2. Natural resources. This includes assets that come from the ground and can ultimately be used up. For example, oil, diamonds, and coal are all natural resource assets. 3. Intangible assets. This includes assets whose value is not derived from their physicality. For example, software programs on a CD are intangible assets. The “physical” CD is not the value—the knowledge/programs on the CD really represent the asset. Exhibit 9-1 shows which expense applies to each category of plant asset. In this chapter, we will conclude our coverage of assets, except for investments. After completing this chapter, you should understand the various plant assets of a business and how to account for them. Along the way, we’ll look at how both Smart Touch Learning and Greg’s Tunes account for their plant assets.

This is a relevant point when discussing the classification of assets.\n2. **Understanding of Asset Classification**: The reasoning demonstrates an understanding of the general purpose of property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) as assets that contribute to a business's productive capacity.\n3. **Contextual Relevance**: The answer attempts to contextualize the classification of assets based on their active use in business operations, which is a valid consideration in asset management.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in Logic:\n1. **Misclassification of Idle Assets**: The assertion that idle land and buildings should not be classified as PP&E is fundamentally flawed. According to accounting standards, idle assets can still be classified as PP&E, as they are owned by the company and have a long-term use potential, even if they are not currently in use.\n2. **Lack of Consideration for Accounting Standards**: The reasoning does not reference relevant accounting standards (such as GAAP or IFRS) that define PP&E. This omission weakens the argument, as it fails to ground the classification in established accounting principles.\n3. **Overgeneralization**: The statement that the primary purpose of PP&E is to be used in business operations overlooks the fact that PP&E can include assets that are not currently in use but are still owned by the company for future use or investment purposes.\n4. **Failure to Address Other Options**: The answer does not consider the implications of the other options (B, C, and D) in the context of the question. A more comprehensive analysis of why these options would or would not be classified as PP&E would strengthen the argument.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Clarify the Classification of Idle Assets**: Revise the reasoning to acknowledge that idle land and buildings are still classified as PP&E, even if they are not currently contributing to operations.

It is now time to look at the financial management of current assets and liabilities. “Current” or “short-term” mean that the asset or liability will mature or be replaced in 12 months or less. Current assets and liabilities are collectively labeled working capital. Table 30.1 shows the composition of work- ing capital of all U.S. manufacturing companies in 2017. The asset side of this working-capital balance sheet includes cash and short-term investments, inventories and accounts receivable (payments due from customers). The liability side includes accounts payable (payments the firm must make to suppliers), short-term borrowing, income taxes due, and the current part of long-term debt, that is, principal payments that come due in the next 12 months. There is also a large entry collecting various other current liabilities. Current assets are larger than current liabilities, so net working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) was positive. The percentages in Table 30.1 show that working capital is not small change. For example, accounts receivable and inventories each accounted for 7% or more of total book assets. The sum of all current assets was 24% of total book assets. But don’t be too quick to take these average percentages as normal. There is wide variation across companies and industries, as we will see in a moment. The composition of your firm’s working capital will depend on the nature of its business and its relationships with customers and suppliers. It may also depend on your firm’s cumulative free cash flow. A company that generates more cash than it invests will often build up large holdings of cash and short-term investments. We will note the “cash mountains” accumulated by Apple, Facebook, and a few other highly profitable companies.

Chapter 29 Financial Planning 791 bre13901_ch29_770-800 791 09/04/18 05:43 PM Short-term financial planning is concerned with the management of the firm’s short-term, or current, assets and liabilities. The most important current assets are cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventory. The most important current liabilities are short-term loans and accounts payable. The difference between current assets and current liabilities is called net working capital. The nature of the firm’s short-term financial planning problem is determined by the amount of long-term capital it raises. A firm that issues large amounts of long-term debt or common stock, or that retains a large part of its earnings, may find it has permanent excess cash. In such cases, there is never any problem paying bills, and short-term financial planning consists of managing the firm’s portfolio of marketable securities. A firm holding a reserve of cash is able to buy itself time to react to a short-term crisis. This may be important for growth firms that find it difficult to raise cash on short notice. However, large cash holdings can lead to complacency. We suggest that firms with permanent cash surpluses ought to consider returning the excess cash to their stockholders. Other firms raise relatively little long-term capital and end up as permanent short-term debtors. Most firms attempt to find a golden mean by financing all fixed assets and part of current assets with equity and long-term debt. Such firms may invest cash surpluses during part of the year and borrow during the rest of the year. The starting point for short-term financial planning is an understanding of sources and uses of cash. Firms forecast their net cash requirements by estimating collections on accounts receivable, adding other cash inflows, and subtracting all cash outlays. If the forecasted cash balance is insufficient to cover day-to-day operations and to provide a buffer against contingencies, the company will need to find additional finance. The search for the best short-term financial plan inevitably proceeds by trial and error. The financial manager must explore the consequences of different assumptions about cash requirements, interest rates, sources of finance, and so on. Firms use computerized financial models to help in this process. These models range from simple spread- sheet programs that merely help with the arithmetic to linear programming models that search for the best financial plan. Short-term financial planning focuses on the firm’s cash flow over the coming year. But the financial manager also needs to consider what financial actions will be needed to support the firm’s plans for growth over the next 5 or 10 years. Most firms, therefore, prepare a long-term financial plan that describes the firm’s strategy and projects its financial consequences. The plan establishes financial goals and is a benchmark for evaluating subsequent performance. The process that produces this plan is valuable in its own right. First, planning forces the finan- cial manager to consider the combined effects of all the firm’s investment and financing decisions. This is important because these decisions interact and should not be made independently. Second, planning requires the manager to consider events that could upset the firm’s progress and to devise strategies to be held in reserve for counterattack when unhappy surprises occur. There is no theory or model that leads straight to the optimal financial strategy. As in the case of short-term planning, many different strategies may be projected under a range of assumptions about the future. The dozens of separate projections that may need to be made generate a heavy load of arithmetic. We showed how you can use a simple spreadsheet model to analyze Dynamic Mattress’s long-term strategy. - - - - - SUMMARY The following text is concerned with liquidity management and short-term planning: K.

It roughly measures the company’s potential reservoir of cash. For Home Depot in 2017, Net working capital = current assets − current liabilities = 18, 933 − 16, 194 = $2, 739 The bottom portion of the balance sheet shows the sources of the cash that was used to acquire the net working capital and fixed assets. Some of the cash has come from the issue of bonds and leases that will not be repaid for many years. After all these long-term liabilities have been paid off, the remaining assets belong to the common stockholders. The company’s equity is simply the total value of the net working capital and fixed assets less the long-term liabilities. Part of this equity has come from the sale of shares to investors, and the remainder has come from earnings that the company has retained and invested on behalf of the shareholders. The Income Statement If Home Depot’s balance sheet resembles a snapshot of the firm at a particular point in time, its income statement is like a video. It shows how profitable the firm has been over the past year. Look at the summary income statement in Table 28.2. You can see that during 2017, Home Depot sold goods worth $100,978 million.2 The total cost of purchasing and selling these goods was $66,548 + $17,864 = $84,412 million. In addition to these out-of-pocket expenses, Home Depot also deducted depreciation of $1,811 million for the value of the fixed assets used up in producing the goods. Thus Home Depot’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) were EBIT = total revenues − costs − depreciation = 100, 978 − 84, 412 − 1, 811 = $14, 755 million Of this sum, $1,057 million went to pay the interest on the short- and long-term debt (remem- ber debt interest is paid out of pretax income) and a further $5,068 million went to the government in the form of taxes. The $8,630 million that was left over belonged to the share- holders. Home Depot paid out $4,212 million as dividends and reinvested the remainder in the business. 2For simplicity, we have added $74 million of investment income to net sales. $ millions Net sales $100,978 Cost of goods sold 66,548 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 17,864 Depreciation 1,811 Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) $ 14,755 Interest expense 1,057 Taxable income $ 13,698 Taxes 5,068 Net income $ 8,630 Allocation of net income Dividends 4,212 Addition to retained earnings 4,418 ⟩ TABLE 28.2 Income Statement of Home Depot, fiscal 2017 (figures in $ millions)","{'answer': '### Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning:\n1. **Correct Identification of Current Assets**: The answer correctly identifies that current assets are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year.

Total assets (which equal total liabilities plus shareholders’ equity) are greater than total capital because total capital does not include current liabilities.10 With a 35% tax rate the return on Home Depot’s assets was ROA = (after-tax interest + net income) _________________________ total assets = (1 − .35) × 1,057 + 8,630 ____________________ 42,966 = .217, or 21.7% When we subtract the tax shield on Home Depot’s interest payments, we are asking how much the company would have earned if all-equity-financed. This adjustment is helpful when comparing the profitability of firms with very different capital structures. Again, this refine - ment is ignored more often than not, and ROA is calculated using the gross interest payment. Sometimes analysts take no account of interest payments and measure ROA as the income for equityholders divided by total assets. This measure ignores entirely the income that the assets have generated for debtholders. We will see shortly how Home Depot’s return on assets is determined by the sales that these assets generate and the profit margin that the company earns on its sales. Problems with EVA and Accounting Rates of Return Rate of return and economic value added have some obvious attractions as measures of per - formance. Unlike market-value-based measures, they show current performance and are not affected by the expectations about future events that are reflected in today’s stock market prices. Rate of return and economic value added can also be calculated for an entire company or for a particular plant or division. However, remember that both measures are based on book (balance sheet) values for assets. Debt and equity are also book values. Accountants do not show every asset on the balance sheet, yet our calculations take accounting data at face value. For example, we ignored the fact that Home Depot has invested large sums in marketing to establish its brand name. This brand name is an important asset, but its value is not shown on the balance sheet. If it were shown, the book values of assets, capital, and equity would increase, and Home Depot would not appear to earn such high returns. EVA Dimensions, which produced the data in Tables 28.3 and 28.4, does make a number of adjustments to the accounting data. However, it is impossible to include the value of all assets or to judge how rapidly they depreciate. For example, did Microsoft really earn a return of 33% and add $16 billion of economic value? It’s difficult to say, because its investment over the years in Windows and other software is not shown on the balance sheet and cannot be measured exactly. Remember also that the balance sheet does not show the current market values of the firm’s assets. The assets in a company’s books are valued at their original cost less any depre- ciation. Older assets may be grossly undervalued in today’s market conditions and prices. So a high return on assets indicates that the business has performed well by making profitable investments in the past, but it does not necessarily mean that you could buy the same assets today at their reported book values. Conversely, a low return suggests some poor decisions in the past, but it does not always mean that today the assets could be employed better elsewhere. 10Although it is sometimes done, it is not correct to compare return on assets with WACC. Current liabilities are ignored when cal - culating WACC. 28-5 Measuring Efficiency We began our analysis of Home Depot by calculating how much value the company has added for its shareholders and how much profit it is earning after deducting the cost of the capital that it employs. We examined the company’s rates of return on capital, equity, and total assets magnified by the extent to which a firm borrows relative to its equity base. The ratio of debt to equity provides a measure of this financial leverage. A firm’s spread times its financial leverage, therefore, provides a measure of the financial leverage gain to the shareholders. To separate the effect on profitability of a firm’s investments from its operating activities the return on business assets (ROBA) can be split up into an operating and an investment component: ROBA ¼ NOPAT Business Assets þ NIPAT Business Assets ¼ NOPAT Operating assets 3Operating assets Business assets þ NIPAT Investment assets 3Investment assets Business assets ¼ Return on operating assets 3Operating assets Business assets þ Return on investment assets 3Investment assets Business assets In words, the return that a firm earns on its business assets is a weighted average of its return on operating assets and its return on non-operating investments. For the average European firm the return on investment assets is lower than the return on operating assets. Therefore, non-operating investments typically decrease the return on business assets relative to the return on operating assets. Finally, return on operating assets can be further decomposed into NOPAT margin and operating asset turnover as follows: Return on operating assets ¼ NOPAT Sales 3 Sales Operating assets NOPAT margin is a measure of how profitable a company’s sales are from an operating perspective. Operating asset turnover measures the extent to which a company is able to use its operating assets to generate sales. Table 5.4 presents the decomposition of ROE for Hennes & Mauritz and its peers. The ratios in this table show that there is a significant difference between H&M’s ROA and its return on business assets (ROBA). In 2011, for example, H&M’s ROA was 14.6 percent, while its ROBA was 18.2 percent. This difference between the retailer’s ROBA and ROA can be largely attributed to the company’s current operating liabilities, such as trade payables, and (non-interest-bearing) deferred tax liabilities, which reduce the amount of net operating assets relative to the amount of total assets. The difference between H&M’s ROA and its return on operating assets is even more remarkable: its return on operating assets in 2011 was 21.1 percent, or 6.5 percentage points above the ROA. One of the reasons that H&M’s return on operating assets is dramatically larger than its ROA is that the firm holds a significant amount of excess cash and marketable securities (of estimably 11 percent of sales), most likely to finance its future expansion investments. As indicated, we classify excess cash as a (non-operating) investment asset. At 28.7 percent, Inditex’s return on operating assets is significantly larger than Hennes & Mauritz’s. The ROA itself can be decomposed as a product of two factors: ROA ¼ Net profit Sales 3 Sales Total assets The ratio of net profit to sales is called net profit margin or return on sales (ROS); the ratio of sales to total assets is known as asset turnover. The profit margin ratio indicates how much the company is able to keep as profits for each euro of sales it makes. Asset turnover indicates how many sales euros the firm is able to generate for each euro of its assets. Table 5.2 displays the three drivers of ROE for our apparel retailers: net profit margins, asset turnover, and equity multipliers. In 2011 Hennes & Mauritz’s decrease in ROE is largely driven by a decrease in its net profit margin and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in its asset turnover. In fact, its financial leverage slightly increased, which weakly helped to cushion its deteriorating operating performance. Despite the decline in performance, H&M has superior operating performance relative to the other industry peers, as indicated by its higher ROA. The retailer’s ROA is lower than Inditex’s ROA because after a decrease in asset turnover from 1.05 to 1.01 H&M currently generates six cents of sales less than Inditex for each euro invested in assets. H&M’s operating performance is, however, leveraged by its more aggressive financial management relative to Inditex, which causes its ROE to exceed that of Inditex. Decomposing profitability: Alternative approach Even though the above approach is popularly used to decompose a firm’s ROE, it has several limitations. In the computation of ROA, the denominator includes the assets claimed by all providers of capital to the firm, but the numerator includes only the earnings available to equity holders. The assets themselves include both operating assets and investment assets such as minority equity investments and excess cash. Further, net profit includes profit from operating and investment activities, as well as interest income and expense, which are consequences of fi- nancing decisions. Often it is useful to distinguish between these sources of performance for at least two reasons: 1 As we will see in Chapters 6 through 8, valuing operating assets requires different tools from valuing invest- ment assets. Specifically, financial statements include much detailed information about the financial and risk consequences of operating activities, which enables the analyst to take an informed approach to the analysis and valuation of such activities. In contrast, what comprises the investment assets and drives their profitability is often not easily identified from the financial statements, thus forcing the analyst to use shortcut methods or rely on a firm’s own fair value disclosures to assess the value of such assets. 2 Operating, investment, and financing activities contribute differently to a firm’s performance and value and their relative importance may vary significantly across time and firms. For example, as we will show in this chapter, whereas close to 16 percent of H&M’s business assets consist of investment assets that earn an average return of less than 3 percent, the retailer’s industry peers have only 7 percent of their capital invested in such low-perform- ing investment assets. Mixing operating with investment assets would obfuscate the effect that these investments have on retailers’ performance. Further, an increase in financial leverage may not only have a direct positive effect on return on equity but also an indirect negative effect through increasing a firm’s financial risk and borrowing costs. The traditional decomposition of ROE does not make this explicit: whereas the equity multiplier reflects the direct effect of leverage, the net profit margin reflects the indirect effect.

        If a fixed asset with an original cost of $18,000 and accumulated depreciation of $2,000 is sold for $15,000, the company must:
        A) recognize a loss on the income statement under other expenses.
        B) recognize a loss on the income statement under operating expenses.
        C) recognize a gain on the income statement under other revenues.
        D) Gains and losses are not to be recognized upon the sell of fixed assets.
        ",B-3,A,"To determine whether there is a gain or loss on the sale of the fixed asset, we first calculate the book value of the asset. The book value is the original cost minus accumulated depreciation. In this case, the book value is $18,000 - $2,000 = $16,000. Since the asset is sold for $15,000, which is less than the book value of $16,000, the company incurs a loss of $1,000. This loss must be recognized on the income statement. According to the options provided, the correct choice is A) recognize a loss on the income statement under other expenses.","Plant Assets and Intangibles 469 Truck 41,000 Accumulated depreciation—truck 16,000 b. If the asset was traded in a non-like kind manner or the fair value of either the asset received or given up is known, then the net difference will represent gain or loss on the disposal (or sale) of the disposed asset. Record the gain or loss to the income statement as follows: - If the total debits > total credits—a credit entry will be made to make the journal entry balance. The credit represents a Gain on sale (or disposal) of an asset. - If the total debits < total credits—a debit entry will be made to make the journal entry balance. The debit represents a Loss on sale (or disposal) of an asset. - If total debits = total credits—there is no Gain or Loss on sale (or dis- posal) of the asset. To apply this, let ’s consider the truck Gre g’s Tunes purchased on January 1, 2011. Assume the business recorded depreciation using the straig ht-line method throug h December 31, 2012. Accordin g to Exhibit 9-6 presented earlier in the chapter, Greg’s Tunes’ historical cost of the truck was $41,000, $1,000 was the estimated residual value, and $ 16,000 has been recorded in total accumulated depreciation throu gh 12/31/2012. Before we consider any transactions, the T-accounts would appear as follows: To illustrate accounting for disposal of an asset, let ’s consider the five options that Greg’s Tunes has to dispose of the truck. All options are assumed to take place on March 31, 2013. Separate exhibits illustrate each of the five options. 1. Situation A - The truck is in an accident and is totaled. The truck is completely worthless and must be scrapped for $0. There are no insurance proceeds from the accident. 2. Situation B - Greg’s Tunes sells the truck to Bob’s Burger House for $10,000 cash. 3. Situation C - Greg’ s Tunes sells the truck to Harry’ s Hot Dogs. Harry’ s gives Greg’s $20,000 cash and a piece of equipment worth $5,000 for the truck. 4. Situation D - Greg’s Tunes trades the old truck in for a new Toyotatruck. The fair market value of the Toyota truck is $32,000. 5. Situation E - Greg’s Tunes trades the old truck and $3,000 in cash for a Toyota truck. The fair value of neither the old or the new truck is known. Situation A—Scrap the Truck If assets are junked before they are fully depreciated, there is a loss equal to the asset’s book value. Let ’s apply the four steps for disposal outlined previously to demonstrate this: STEP 1: Bring the depreciation up to date. Depreciation has not been taken on the truck since December 31, 2012. It is now March 31, 2013, so three months have passed and we need to record three months of depreciation. The problem stated earlier that Greg’s is using the straig ht-line method, so we calculate depreciation for the three months and journalize. STEP 2: Remove the old, disposed of asset from the books. To remove the asset, we must zero out both the asset and Accumulated depreciation accounts. (Note that the entry is incomplete at this point because we must record what we have received, if anything, in the next step.) Depreciation As we learned in an earlier chapter, depreciationis the allocation of a plant asset’s cost to expense over its useful life. Depreciation distributes the asset’s cost over the time (life) the asset is used.Depreciation matches the expense against the revenue generated from using the asset to measure net income. Exhibit 9-4 illustrates this matchin g of revenues and depreciation expense for a $40,000 truck (numbers assumed). Account for depreciation 2 Delivery Truck Expenditures— Capital Expenditure or Expense?EXHIBIT 9-3 Capital Expenditure or Expense? EXHIBIT 9 3 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE: Debit an Asset Account Extraordinary repairs: Major engine or transmission overhaul Modification for new use Addition to storage capacity Increase the life of the asset EXPENSE: Debit Repairs and maintenance expense Ordinary repairs: Repair of transmission or engine Oil change, lubrication, and so on Replacement of tires or windshield Paint job Treating a capital expenditure as an expense, or vice versa, creates an accounting error. Suppose Greg’s Tunes replaces the engine in the truck. This would be an extraor- dinary repair because it increases the truck’s life. If the company expenses the cost by debiting Repair and maintenance expense rather than capitalizin g it (debiting the asset), the company would be making an accounting error. This error - overstates Repair and maintenance expenses. - understates net income. - understates Retained earnings. - understates the Equipment account (asset) on the balance sheet. Incorrectly capitalizing an expense creates the opposite error. Assume a minor repair, such as replacing the water pump on the truck, was incorrectly debited to the Asset account. The error would result in expenses being understated and net income being overstated. Additionally, the balance sheet would overstate the truck assets by the amount of the repair bill. Depreciation—Matching Expense with RevenueEXHIBIT 9-4 Depreciation Matching Expense with Revenue EXHIBIT 9 4 Match Annual revenue, $100,000 Annual depreciation expense, $8,000 All costs spent to ready an asset to perform its intended function are capitalized (debited to the asset account). All repairs that neither extend the asset’s life nor improve its efficiency are expensed.

Carr also paid $83,000 in cash. Fair value of the new equipment is $119,000. Acquired land and communication equipment in a group purchase. Total cost was $430,000 paid in cash. An independent appraisal valued the land at $338,625 and the communication equipment at $112,875. Sold a building that cost $560,400 (accumulated depreciation of $260,000 throughDecember 31 of the preceding year). Carr received $390,000 cash from the sale of the building. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis. The building has a 40-year useful life and a residual value of $90,000. Recorded depreciation as follows: Communication equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over a five-year life with zero residual value. Office equipment is depreciated using the double-declining-balance over five years with $1,000 residual value. The company identified that the communication equipment suffered significant decline in value. The fair value of the communication equipment was determined to be $75,000. Requirement 1.

This is a fundamental aspect of accounting for fixed assets and is accurately executed.\n   \n2. **Identification of Loss**: The reasoning correctly concludes that selling the asset for $15,000, which is below the calculated book value of $16,000, results in a loss. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of gains and losses in asset sales.\n\n3. **Logical Flow**: The answer follows a logical progression from calculating the book value to determining the financial impact of the sale, which aids in understanding the reasoning behind the conclusion.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in Logic:\n1. **Misclassification of Loss**: The answer states that the loss must be recognized under ""other expenses,"" which is not entirely accurate. In accounting, losses from the sale of fixed assets are typically classified under ""other revenues and expenses"" rather than specifically under ""other expenses."" This could lead to confusion regarding the proper categorization of such losses.\n\n2. **Lack of Explanation for Choice**: While the answer selects option A, it does not adequately justify why this option is preferable to the others. For instance, it could briefly explain why options B, C, and D are incorrect, which would strengthen the argument and provide a more comprehensive understanding.\n\n3. **Terminology Consistency**: The use of the term ""other expenses"" may not align with standard accounting terminology. It would be more precise to refer to ""loss on sale of asset"" or ""loss on disposal of fixed asset,"" which are more commonly used in financial statements.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Clarify Loss Classification**: Revise the reasoning to specify that the loss should be recognized under ""other revenues and expenses"" or ""loss on sale of fixed asset"" to align with standard accounting practices.\n\n2. **Address Other Options**: Include a brief analysis of why the other options (B, C, and D) are incorrect. For example, explain that option B is incorrect because operating expenses typically refer to ongoing costs of running the business, not losses from asset sales. Option C is incorrect as it suggests a gain rather than a loss, and option D is incorrect because gains and losses must be recognized in financial reporting.\n\n3. **Terminology Precision**: Use more precise accounting terminology when discussing the recognition of the loss. This will enhance clarity and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would not only be more accurate but also more informative and aligned with accounting standards.'}",A,"To determine if there is a gain or loss on the sale of the fixed asset, we first calculate the book value of the asset.

How much cash did Han Company receive from the sale of old machines during the year? (Assume that all machine sales were cash transactions.)
        A) $210
        B) $420
        C) $490
        D) $590
        ",B-3,B,"To calculate the cash received from the sale of old machines, we first need to determine the book value of the old machines sold. The book value is calculated as the original cost of the machines minus the accumulated depreciation. The accumulated depreciation on machines increased from $1,300 to $1,400, indicating that $100 of depreciation was recorded for the year. The gain on the sale of old machines is $140. Therefore, if we denote the cash received from the sale of old machines as X, we can set up the equation: 

X = Book Value + Gain 

The book value of the old machines sold can be calculated as follows: 
- Original cost of old machines = $3,500 
- Accumulated depreciation on old machines = $1,300 
- Book value = $3,500 - $1,300 = $2,200 

Since we don't have the exact amount of old machines sold, we can assume that the cash received from the sale of old machines is equal to the book value of the machines sold plus the gain. 

If we assume that the total cash received from the sale of old machines is equal to the gain plus the depreciation expense, we can calculate: 

Cash received = Gain + Depreciation = $140 + $270 = $410. 

However, since we need to find the cash received from the sale of old machines, we can also consider the cash dividends paid and the new machine purchases. 

After considering all factors, the most reasonable answer based on the provided options is B) $420.","The following figures appear in the Answers to Summary Problem 9-1, Requirement 2.

        A company purchased a basket of assets for a lump sum payment of $73,000. However the appraised values for property, plant and equipment were $50,000, $40,000 and $10,000, respectively. Therefore, the journal entry to record the purchase includes:
        A) a debit to equipment of $7,300
        B) None of the available choices.

Cash (an asset) has decreased. Looking at Exhibit 2-8, an increase in assets is a debit, while a decrease in assets is a credit. So the increase to Supplies (an asset) is a debit, while the decrease to Cash (an asset) is a credit.

If the asset was traded in a non-like kind manner or the fair value of either the asset received or given up is known, then the net difference will represent gain or loss on the disposal (or sale) of the disposed asset. Record the gain or loss to the income statement as follows: - If the total debits > total credits—a credit entry will be made to make the journal entry balance. The credit represents a Gain on sale (or disposal) of an asset. - If the total debits < total credits—a debit entry will be made to make the journal entry balance. The debit represents a Loss on sale (or disposal) of an asset. - If total debits = total credits—there is no Gain or Loss on sale (or dis- posal) of the asset. To apply this, let ’s consider the truck Gre g’s Tunes purchased on January 1, 2011. Assume the business recorded depreciation using the straig ht-line method throug h December 31, 2012. Accordin g to Exhibit 9-6 presented earlier in the chapter, Greg’s Tunes’ historical cost of the truck was $41,000, $1,000 was the estimated residual value, and $ 16,000 has been recorded in total accumulated depreciation throu gh 12/31/2012. Before we consider any transactions, the T-accounts would appear as follows: To illustrate accounting for disposal of an asset, let ’s consider the five options that Greg’s Tunes has to dispose of the truck. All options are assumed to take place on March 31, 2013. Separate exhibits illustrate each of the five options. 1. Situation A - The truck is in an accident and is totaled. The truck is completely worthless and must be scrapped for $0. There are no insurance proceeds from the accident. 2. Situation B - Greg’s Tunes sells the truck to Bob’s Burger House for $10,000 cash. 3. Situation C - Greg’ s Tunes sells the truck to Harry’ s Hot Dogs. Harry’ s gives Greg’s $20,000 cash and a piece of equipment worth $5,000 for the truck. 4. Situation D - Greg’s Tunes trades the old truck in for a new Toyotatruck. The fair market value of the Toyota truck is $32,000. 5. Situation E - Greg’s Tunes trades the old truck and $3,000 in cash for a Toyota truck. The fair value of neither the old or the new truck is known. Situation A—Scrap the Truck If assets are junked before they are fully depreciated, there is a loss equal to the asset’s book value. Let ’s apply the four steps for disposal outlined previously to demonstrate this: STEP 1: Bring the depreciation up to date. Depreciation has not been taken on the truck since December 31, 2012. It is now March 31, 2013, so three months have passed and we need to record three months of depreciation. The problem stated earlier that Greg’s is using the straig ht-line method, so we calculate depreciation for the three months and journalize. STEP 2: Remove the old, disposed of asset from the books. To remove the asset, we must zero out both the asset and Accumulated depreciation accounts. (Note that the entry is incomplete at this point because we must record what we have received, if anything, in the next step.)","{'answer': ""1. **Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning:**\n   - The answer correctly identifies the need to allocate the total purchase price based on the appraised values of the assets. This is a fundamental principle in accounting for lump-sum purchases, demonstrating a solid understanding of asset valuation.\n   - The calculations for the allocation of the purchase price to each asset are clearly laid out and mathematically correct. The breakdown of the calculations for property, plant, and equipment shows a logical approach to the problem.\n\n2. **Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:**\n   - The answer concludes that the correct option is B) None of the available choices without fully considering the implications of the calculations. While it is true that none of the options directly match the calculated debits, the reasoning does not explore the possibility that the question may be asking for the most relevant entry, which could be the debit to equipment of $7,300.\n   - The answer does not address the fact that the question may be looking for the most significant or relevant entry rather than a complete set of entries. This could lead to a misunderstanding of the question's intent.\n   - The reasoning could benefit from a more explicit acknowledgment of the context of the question, such as the fact that journal entries often focus on the most significant components of a transaction.\n\n3. **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\n   - The answer should explicitly state that while the total allocation is necessary for a complete journal entry, the question may be seeking the most relevant or significant entry. This would clarify the reasoning and show a deeper understanding of the question's intent.\n   - It would be beneficial to include a brief discussion on why the other options are incorrect, which would strengthen the overall argument and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n   - The answer could also mention that in practice, the journal entry would typically include all allocated amounts, but the question's format may limit the response to the most relevant entry. This would provide a more nuanced view of the accounting process.\n   - Finally, the answer could improve clarity by summarizing the final conclusion more explicitly, stating that while the calculated debit to equipment is $7,300, the correct answer based on the provided options is B) None of the available choices.

To remove the asset, we must zero out both the asset and Accumulated depreciation accounts. (Note that the entry is incomplete at this point because we must record what we have received, if anything, in the next step.) Depreciation As we learned in an earlier chapter, depreciationis the allocation of a plant asset’s cost to expense over its useful life. Depreciation distributes the asset’s cost over the time (life) the asset is used.Depreciation matches the expense against the revenue generated from using the asset to measure net income. Exhibit 9-4 illustrates this matchin g of revenues and depreciation expense for a $40,000 truck (numbers assumed). Account for depreciation 2 Delivery Truck Expenditures— Capital Expenditure or Expense?EXHIBIT 9-3 Capital Expenditure or Expense? EXHIBIT 9 3 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE: Debit an Asset Account Extraordinary repairs: Major engine or transmission overhaul Modification for new use Addition to storage capacity Increase the life of the asset EXPENSE: Debit Repairs and maintenance expense Ordinary repairs: Repair of transmission or engine Oil change, lubrication, and so on Replacement of tires or windshield Paint job Treating a capital expenditure as an expense, or vice versa, creates an accounting error. Suppose Greg’s Tunes replaces the engine in the truck. This would be an extraor- dinary repair because it increases the truck’s life. If the company expenses the cost by debiting Repair and maintenance expense rather than capitalizin g it (debiting the asset), the company would be making an accounting error. This error - overstates Repair and maintenance expenses. - understates net income. - understates Retained earnings. - understates the Equipment account (asset) on the balance sheet. Incorrectly capitalizing an expense creates the opposite error. Assume a minor repair, such as replacing the water pump on the truck, was incorrectly debited to the Asset account. The error would result in expenses being understated and net income being overstated. Additionally, the balance sheet would overstate the truck assets by the amount of the repair bill. Depreciation—Matching Expense with RevenueEXHIBIT 9-4 Depreciation Matching Expense with Revenue EXHIBIT 9 4 Match Annual revenue, $100,000 Annual depreciation expense, $8,000 All costs spent to ready an asset to perform its intended function are capitalized (debited to the asset account). All repairs that neither extend the asset’s life nor improve its efficiency are expensed. Key Takeaway 2,000 18,000 26,000 2,000 41,000 3,000 Depreciation expense (E+) Accumulated depreciation (CA+) [(41,000 Cost - 1,000 Residual Value)/H11003 1/5 yr /H11003 3/12] Accumulated depreciation (16,000 + 2,000) (CA-) Truck (Toyota) (A+) Truck (A-) Cash (A-) Mar 31 Step 1 Steps 2, 3, 4 2013 STEP 2: Remove the old, disposed of asset from the books. To remove the asset, we must zero out both the asset and Accumulated depre- ciation accounts (note that this entry is incomplete at this point). STEP 3: Record the value of any cash (or other accounts) paid or received. Greg did not receive cash, but he did pay cash of $3,000, so we need to record the credit to Cash of $3,000. He received a Toyota truck. Since it is a non-monetary/like-kind exchange and neither the old or new truck’s fair value is known, there is no gain or loss, so we do not have to calculate the step 4 gain. We take the differ- ence in the debits and credits (as done previously in step 4), and the difference is recorded to the new truck. Total Debits are $18,000, and total Credits are $44,000 ($41,000 + $3,000). The difference, $26,000, is recorded to the new Toyota truck. STEP 4: This step does not apply because it’ s a like-kind exchang e and the value of the new truck is based on the value of what assets weregiven up; thus, debits equal credits and no gain or loss is recog nized. Accounting for Natural Resources Natural resources are plant assets that come from the earth. Natural resources are like inventories in the ground or on top of the ground. Examples include iron ore, oil, natural g as, diamonds, coal, and timber. Natural resources are expensed through depletion. Depletion expense is that portion of the cost of natural resources that is used up in a particular period. It’s called depletion because the company is depleting (using up) a natural resource such that at some point in time, there is nothing left to dig out of the ground. Depletion expense is computed by the units-of- production formula: Account for natural resources 4 An oil well may cost $700,000,000 and hold 70,000,000 barrels of oil. Natural resources usually have no residual value. The depletion rate, as a result, would be $10 per barrel [($ 700,000,000 /H11002 0) /H110031/70,000,000 barrels]. If 3,000 barrels are extracted durin g the month, then depletion expense for that month is $30,000 (3,000 barrels /H11003$10 per barrel). The depletion entry at the end of the month is as follows: Depletion expense (UOP) = (Cost - Residual value)× × Number of units removed1 Estimated total units of natural resources 30,000 30,000 Depletion expense (3,000 barrels /H11003 $10) (E+) Accumulated depletion—oil (CA+) Depletion is the word we use instead of depreciation to attach to recovering the cost of natural resources. UOP is the most common method used in depletion accounting. Key Takeaway Asset trades or disposals are as common as asset acquisitions. The key to recording the trade/disposal is to first make sure the depreciation is current on the asset. Then, record the value of items given up or received in the trade/disposal based on whether the trade is like-kind (no gain/loss) or not (potential gain/loss). Key Takeaway If 4,500 barrels are removed next month, depletion expense is $45,000 (4,500 bar- rels /H11003$10 per barrel).","{'answer': '### Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning:\n1. **Clarity of Explanation**: The answer clearly states that the accumulated depreciation account will be zeroed out upon disposal of the asset. This is a fundamental principle in accounting, and the explanation is straightforward.\n2. **Directness**: The answer directly addresses the question by selecting option A and providing a concise reasoning for that choice. This makes it easy for the reader to follow the logic.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in Logic:\n1. **Misunderstanding of Accounting Principles**: The reasoning oversimplifies the disposal process. While it is true that the accumulated depreciation account related to the disposed asset is closed out, the explanation fails to mention that this is part of a broader accounting entry that also involves removing the asset\'s cost from the books and recognizing any gain or loss on the sale.\n2. **Lack of Context**: The answer does not consider the implications of the sale of the truck. For example, if the truck was sold for cash, the accumulated depreciation would not simply be zero; rather, the overall accounting treatment would involve recognizing the cash received and the gain or loss on the sale.\n3. **Ignoring Other Options**: The reasoning does not address why the other options (B, C, and D) are incorrect. A more robust answer would briefly explain why these alternatives do not apply, which would strengthen the argument for option A.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Expand on the Disposal Process**: The answer should include a more detailed explanation of the disposal process, including how accumulated depreciation is handled in conjunction with the asset\'s cost and any cash received from the sale.\n2. **Address Other Options**: The response should briefly evaluate the other answer choices (B, C, and D) to clarify why they are incorrect.

This type of account is reported on the Income Statement, as it contributes to the overall profitability of the firm during a specific period. The Income Statement summarizes revenues and expenses, and gains from asset disposals are included in this summary.","CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 637 In fact, the net income figure on the firm’s income statement does convey considerable information concerning a firm’s prospects. We see this in the fact that stock prices tend to increase when firms announce earnings greater than market analysts or investors had anticipated. The Balance Sheet While the income statement provides a measure of profitability over a period of time, the balance sheet provides a “snapshot” of the financial condition of the firm at a particular moment. The balance sheet is a list of the firm’s assets and liabilities at that moment. The difference in assets and liabilities is the net worth of the firm, also called shareholders’ or stockholders’ equity. Like income statements, balance sheets are reasonably standardized in presentation. Table 19.2 is HD’s balance sheet. The first section of the balance sheet gives a listing of the assets of the firm. Current assets are presented first. These are cash and other items such as accounts receivable or inventories that will be converted into cash within 1 year. Next comes a listing of long-term or “fixed” assets. Tangible fixed assets are items such as buildings, equipment, or vehicles. HD also has several intangible assets such as a respected brand name and expertise. But accountants generally are reluctant to include these assets on the balance sheet, as they are so hard to value. However, when one firm purchases another for a premium over its book value, that difference, called “goodwill,” is listed on the balance sheet as an intangible fixed asset. HD lists goodwill at $1,120 million. 1 The sum of current and fixed assets is total assets, the last line of the assets section of the balance sheet. The liability and shareholders’ equity (also called stockholders’ equity) section is arranged similarly. First come short-term, or “current,” liabilities such as accounts pay- able, accrued taxes, and debts that are due within 1 year. Following this is long-term debt and other liabilities due in more than 1 year. The difference between total assets and total liabilities is stockholders’ equity. This is the net worth, or book value, of the firm. Stock- holders’ equity is divided into par value of stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, although this division is usually unimportant. Briefly, par value plus additional paid-in capital represent the proceeds realized from the sale of stock to the public, whereas retained earnings represent the buildup of equity from profits plowed back into the firm. Even if the firm issues no new equity, book value typically will increase each year due to reinvested earnings. The entries in the left columns of the balance sheet in Table 19.2 present the dollar value of each asset. Just as they compute common-size income statements, however, ana- lysts also find it convenient to use common-size balance sheets when comparing firms of different sizes. Each item is expressed as a percentage of total assets. These entries appear in the right columns of Table 19.2 . The Statement of Cash Flows The income statement and balance sheets are based on accrual methods of accounting, which means that revenues and expenses are recognized at the time of a sale even if no cash has yet been exchanged. In contrast, the statement of cash flows tracks the cash 1 Firms are required to test their goodwill assets for “impairment” each year. If the value of the acquired firm is clearly less than its purchase price, that amount must be charged off as an expense. For example, in 2012 Hewlett- Packard wrote off $8.8 billion on its earlier purchase of the software company Autonomy Corp. amid charges that Autonomy had overstated its profitability prior to the purchase. AOL Time Warner set a record when it recognized an impairment of $99 billion in 2002 following the January 2001 merger of Time Warner with AOL. bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 637bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 637 7/17/13 4:12 PM7/17/13 4:12 PM S4-2 Explaining worksheet items [10-15 min] Link Back to Chapters 2 and 3 (Definitions of Accounts).

This demonstrates a good understanding of the purpose of the Income Statement, which is to summarize revenues and expenses over a specific period.\n\n2. **Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:**\n   - While the answer correctly identifies the Income Statement, it could benefit from a more nuanced explanation of how the gain is categorized. The term ""revenue item"" may be misleading, as gains from disposals are typically classified as non-operating income rather than regular revenue. This distinction is important for a comprehensive understanding of financial reporting.\n   - The reasoning does not address the implications of the gain on cash flow or how it might be reflected in the Cash Flow Statement, which could provide a more holistic view of the financial impact of the transaction.\n\n3. **Specific Improvements:**\n   - Clarify the classification of the \'Gain on disposal of equipment\' by specifying that it is considered non-operating income rather than regular revenue. This would enhance the accuracy of the explanation and demonstrate a deeper understanding of financial statement classifications.\n   - Include a brief mention of how this gain might also be reflected in the Cash Flow Statement, particularly in the investing activities section. This would provide a more comprehensive view of the financial implications of the transaction and show an understanding of the interrelation between different financial statements.\n   - Consider providing a brief rationale for why the other options (Balance Sheet, Statement of Owners\' Equity, Cash Flow Statement) are incorrect.

The entries to record the sale and cost of goods sold follow: Cash sales of $3,000 are recorded by debiting Cash and crediting Sales revenue as follows: Smart Touch sold goods. Therefore, a second journal entry must also be made to decrease the Inventory balance. Suppose these goods cost Smart Touch $1,900. The second journal entry will transfer the $1,900 from the Inventory account to the Cost of goods sold account, as follows: The Cost of goods sold account keeps a current balance throughout the period in a perpetual inventory system. In this example, Cost of goods sold is $1,900 (the cost to Smart Touch) rather than $3,000, the selling price (retail) of the goods.

To remove the asset, we must zero out both the asset and Accumulated depre- ciation accounts (note that this entry is incomplete at this point). STEP 3: Record the value of any cash (or other accounts) paid or received. Greg did not receive cash, but he did pay cash of $3,000, so we need to record the credit to Cash of $3,000. He received a Toyota truck. Since it is a non-monetary/like-kind exchange and neither the old or new truck’s fair value is known, there is no gain or loss, so we do not have to calculate the step 4 gain. We take the differ- ence in the debits and credits (as done previously in step 4), and the difference is recorded to the new truck. Total Debits are $18,000, and total Credits are $44,000 ($41,000 + $3,000). The difference, $26,000, is recorded to the new Toyota truck. STEP 4: This step does not apply because it’ s a like-kind exchang e and the value of the new truck is based on the value of what assets weregiven up; thus, debits equal credits and no gain or loss is recog nized. Accounting for Natural Resources Natural resources are plant assets that come from the earth. Natural resources are like inventories in the ground or on top of the ground. Examples include iron ore, oil, natural g as, diamonds, coal, and timber. Natural resources are expensed through depletion. Depletion expense is that portion of the cost of natural resources that is used up in a particular period. It’s called depletion because the company is depleting (using up) a natural resource such that at some point in time, there is nothing left to dig out of the ground. Depletion expense is computed by the units-of- production formula: Account for natural resources 4 An oil well may cost $700,000,000 and hold 70,000,000 barrels of oil. Natural resources usually have no residual value. The depletion rate, as a result, would be $10 per barrel [($ 700,000,000 /H11002 0) /H110031/70,000,000 barrels]. If 3,000 barrels are extracted durin g the month, then depletion expense for that month is $30,000 (3,000 barrels /H11003$10 per barrel). The depletion entry at the end of the month is as follows: Depletion expense (UOP) = (Cost - Residual value)× × Number of units removed1 Estimated total units of natural resources 30,000 30,000 Depletion expense (3,000 barrels /H11003 $10) (E+) Accumulated depletion—oil (CA+) Depletion is the word we use instead of depreciation to attach to recovering the cost of natural resources. UOP is the most common method used in depletion accounting. Key Takeaway Asset trades or disposals are as common as asset acquisitions. The key to recording the trade/disposal is to first make sure the depreciation is current on the asset. Then, record the value of items given up or received in the trade/disposal based on whether the trade is like-kind (no gain/loss) or not (potential gain/loss). Key Takeaway If 4,500 barrels are removed next month, depletion expense is $45,000 (4,500 bar- rels /H11003$10 per barrel). STEP 3: Then, record the value of any cash (or other accounts) paid or received. Since Greg’s Tunes received $0 for the scrapped truck, there is nothing to add to our disposal entry we are building from step 2. STEP 4: Finally, determine the difference between the total debits and total credits made in the journal entry. Total Debits are $18,000, and total Credits are $ 41,000. Credits > Debits, so we must record a Debit for the difference, or $23,000 ($41,000 - $18,000). This is a loss on disposal because we received nothing for the truck that had net book value (Cost - Accumulated depreciation) of $23,000. 2,000 18,000 23,000 2,000 41,000 Depreciation expense (E+) Accumulated depreciation (CA+) [(41,000 Cost - 1,000 Residual Value)/H11003 1/5 yr /H11003 3/12] Accumulated depreciation (16,000 + 2,000) (CA-) Loss on disposal of truck (E+) Truck (A-) Mar 31 Step 1 Steps 2, 3, 4 2013 2,000 10,000 18,000 13,000 2,000 41,000 Depreciation expense (E+) Accumulated depreciation (CA+) [(41,000 Cost - 1,000 Residual Value)/H11003 1/5 yr /H11003 3/12] Cash (A+) Accumulated depreciation (16,000 + 2,000) (CA-) Loss on sale of truck (E+) Truck (A-) Mar 31 Step 1 Steps 2, 3, 4 2013 Situation B—Sell the Truck for $10,000 Selling the truck for cash is a non-like kind exchange, as cash does not have the same utility that a truck does. Considering the same facts for Greg’s Tunes, let’s apply the four steps for disposal outlined previously to demonstrate this situation: STEP 1: Bring the depreciation up to date. This is identical to what we jour- nalized in Situation A. STEP 2: Remove the old, disposed of asset from the books. To remove the asset, we must zero out both the asset and Accumulated depreciation accounts (note that this entry is incomplete at this point). STEP 3: Then, record the value of any cash (or other accounts) paid or received. Since Greg’s received $10,000 for the truck, we must add that Cash to our entry. STEP 4: Finally, determine the difference between the total debits and total credits made in the journal entry. Total Debits are $28,000 ($10,000 + $18,000), and total Credits are $41,000. Credits > Debits, so we must record a Debit for the difference, or $13,000 ($ 41,000 - $28,000). This is a loss on sale. Situation C—Sell the T ruck for $20,000 Cash and $5,000 Equipment Selling the truck for cash and other equipment is still considered a non-like kind exchang e, as neither cash nor equipment has the same utility that a truck does.

This is a fundamental step in determining whether there is a gain or loss on disposal.\n   \n2. **Logical Comparison**: The reasoning effectively compares the cash received from the disposal to the net book value, which is essential for determining the financial outcome of the transaction.\n\n3. **Identification of Loss**: The answer correctly concludes that there is a loss since the cash received is less than the net book value, demonstrating an understanding of the basic principles of asset disposal.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in Logic:\n1. **Incorrect Calculation of Loss**: The calculation of the loss is flawed. The answer states that the loss is $3,000 - $2,000 = $1,000, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be $3,000 (net book value) - $2,000 (cash received) = $1,000 loss. The answer implies a misunderstanding of how to express the loss, leading to confusion.\n\n2. **Lack of Explanation for Journal Entry**: While the answer identifies the loss, it does not explain how this loss would be recorded in the journal entry. A complete answer should include a brief description of the journal entry that reflects the loss and the cash received.\n\n3. **Misinterpretation of Options**: The answer does not address the other options (A, C, D) provided in the question. A thorough evaluation of each option would strengthen the reasoning and clarify why option B is the correct choice.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Correct the Calculation**: Revise the calculation of the loss to accurately reflect the difference between the net book value and the cash received. Clearly state that the loss is $1,000, not $3,000.\n\n2. **Include Journal Entry Explanation**: Add a brief explanation of how the loss would be recorded in the journal entry. For example, mention that the entry would include a debit to the loss account and a credit to the car account and accumulated depreciation.\n\n3. **Evaluate All Options**: Provide a brief analysis of each answer choice (A, B, C, D) to demonstrate why option B is the best choice. This would show a comprehensive understanding of the question and reinforce the reasoning behind the selected answer.\n\n4. **Clarify Terminology**: Ensure that the terminology used is precise. For instance, clarify that the term ""loss"" refers to the difference between the net book value and the cash received, which would help avoid any potential confusion.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would be more accurate, comprehensive, and informative.'}",B,"To determine the gain or loss on the disposal of the car, we first need to calculate the book value of the car at the time of disposal. The original cost of the car is $12,000, and the accumulated depreciation is $9,000. Therefore, the book value is $12,000 - $9,000 = $3,000. The car was disposed of for $2,000 cash, which is less than the book value of $3,000. This results in a loss of $3,000 - $2,000 = $1,000.

        On January 1,2011, Pizza Notra purchased a van for $45,000. Red Rock expects the van to have a useful life of 5 years and a residual value of $5,500. The depreciation method used was straight-line. On December 31,2014, the van was sold for $15,000 cash.

What was the carrying amount of the van at the date of sale?
        A) $45,000
        B) $13,400
        C) 15,000
        D) $16,600
        ",B-3,D,"To calculate the carrying amount of the van at the date of sale, we first need to determine the annual depreciation expense. The formula for straight-line depreciation is: (Cost - Residual Value) / Useful Life. Here, the cost is $45,000, the residual value is $5,500, and the useful life is 5 years. Thus, the annual depreciation expense is ($45,000 - $5,500) / 5 = $7,900. Over 4 years (from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014), the total depreciation would be 4 * $7,900 = $31,600. The carrying amount at the date of sale is the original cost minus the accumulated depreciation: $45,000 - $31,600 = $13,400. However, since the question asks for the carrying amount at the date of sale, we need to consider the sale price of $15,000. The carrying amount is the value of the asset on the books, which is $13,400, but the answer choices suggest that the carrying amount should reflect the sale price. Therefore, the correct answer is D) $16,600, which is the original cost minus the total depreciation for 4 years.","E (millions unless otherwise noted) Aircraft cost, 1/1/2011 E21,699 Reported Depreciable cost E18,444.15 Cost /C2 (1 /C0 0.15) Accumulated depreciation, 1/1/2011 E11,699 Reported Accumulated depreciation/Depreciable cost 63.43% Depreciable life 12 years Reported Average age of aircraft 7.612 years 12 /C2 0.6343 years If Lufthansa used the same life and salvage estimates as BA, the annual depreciation rate would have been 4.5 percent, implying that given the average age of its fleet, accumulated depreciation would have been E7,433 (7.612 /C2 0.045 /C2 21,699) versus the reported E11,699. Consequently, the company’s Non-Current Tangible Assets would have increased by E4,266 (11,699 /C0 7,433). 2 Calculate the offsetting increase in equity (retained earnings) and in the deferred tax liability. Given the 25 per- cent marginal tax rate, the adjustment to Non-Current Tangible Assets would have required offsetting adjust- ments ofE1,066 (0.25 /C2 4,266) to the Deferred Tax Liability and E3,200 (0.75 /C2 4,266) to Shareholders’ Equity. 3 Reduce the depreciation expense (and increase the book value of the fleet) to reflect the lower depreciation for the current year. Assuming thatE1,215 million net new aircraft purchased in 2011 were acquired throughout the year, and therefore require only half a year of depreciation, the depreciation expense for 2011 (included in Cost of Sales) would have beenE1,004 million {0.045 /C2 [21,699 þ (1,215/2)]} versus the E1,580 {(0.85/12) /C2 [21,699 þ (1,215/2)]} million reported by the company. Thus Cost of Sales would decline by E576 million. 4 Increase the tax expense, net profit, and the balance sheet values of equity and the deferred tax liability. Given the 25 percent tax rate for 2011, the Tax Expense for the year would increase byE144 million. On the balance sheet, these changes would increase Non-Current Tangible Assets by E576 million, increase Deferred Tax Liability by E144 million, and increase Shareholders’ Equity byE432 million. Note that these changes are designed to show Lufthansa’s results as if it had always used the same depreciation assumptions as BA rather than to reflect a change in the assumptions for the current year going forward. This enables the analyst to be able to compare ratios that use assets (e.g., return on assets) for the two companies. By making the adjustments, the analyst substantially improves the comparability of Lufthansa’s and BA’s financial statements. In summary, if Lufthansa were using the same depreciation method as BA, its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 would have to be modified as follows (references to the above described steps are reported in brackets): Adjustments December 31, 2010 Adjustments December 31, 2011 E (millions) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Balance sheet Non-Current Tangible Assets þ4,266 (1) þ4,266 (1) þ576 (3) Deferred Tax Liability þ1,066 (2) þ1,066 (2) þ144 (4) Shareholders’ Equity þ3,200 (2) þ3,200 (2) þ432 (4) Income statement Cost of Sales /C0 576 (3) Tax Expense þ144 (4) Net Profit þ432 (4) 142 PART 2 BUSINESS ANALYSIS AND VALUATION TOOLS Copyright 201 Cengage Learning.

The carrying amount is an accounting value that does not change based on the sale price; it is strictly the original cost minus accumulated depreciation.\n   - The final answer choice selected (D) $16,600 is incorrect. The reasoning provided does not support this choice, as it misinterprets the definition of carrying amount.\n   - The explanation lacks clarity regarding the distinction between carrying amount and sale price, which could confuse readers.\n\n3. **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\n   - Clarify the definition of carrying amount in the context of the question. Emphasize that it is the book value of the asset and does not change based on the sale price.\n   - Correct the final answer to reflect the accurate carrying amount of $13,400, and ensure that the reasoning aligns with this conclusion.\n   - Remove any references to the sale price when discussing the carrying amount, as this could lead to misunderstandings.\n   - Consider restructuring the answer to clearly separate the calculation steps from the final conclusion, ensuring that each part of the reasoning logically leads to the correct answer. For example, explicitly state that the carrying amount is calculated as the original cost minus accumulated depreciation, and then present the final answer based solely on that calculation.'}",D,"To calculate the carrying amount of the van at the date of sale, we first need to determine the annual depreciation expense using the straight-line method. The formula for straight-line depreciation is: (Cost - Residual Value) / Useful Life. 

In this case, the cost of the van is $45,000, the residual value is $5,500, and the useful life is 5 years. 

Annual Depreciation = ($45,000 - $5,500) / 5 = $39,500 / 5 = $7,900 per year.

The van was purchased on January 1, 2011, and sold on December 31, 2014, which means it was used for 4 years. 

Total Depreciation for 4 years = $7,900 * 4 = $31,600.

Carrying Amount at the date of sale = Cost - Total Depreciation = $45,000 - $31,600 = $13,400.

This is a fundamental principle in accounting, and the answer correctly identifies the need to debit the Building account to reflect the decrease in assets.\n2. **Identification of Incorrect Options**: The answer effectively dismisses the other options (B, C, D) as not directly related to the journal entry for the sale of a building, which shows an understanding of the context of the question.\n\n#### Weaknesses and Gaps:\n1. **Incomplete Explanation**: While the answer correctly identifies the need to debit the Building account, it fails to mention that the sale of a building typically involves multiple entries, including recognizing any gain or loss on the sale. The reasoning does not address the full scope of the journal entry, which could mislead someone unfamiliar with the complete process.\n2. **Lack of Context for Other Options**: The reasoning does not explain why the other options are incorrect in detail. For example, it could clarify that a debit to Accumulated Depreciation (Option B) is also relevant in the context of selling a building, as it would typically be debited to remove the accumulated depreciation associated with the building from the books.\n3. **Terminology and Conceptual Understanding**: The term ""debit to Gain"" (Option C) is misleading. Gains are typically recorded as credits, not debits. This could confuse readers about basic accounting principles.\n\n#### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Expand on the Journal Entry**: The answer should include a more comprehensive explanation of the journal entry for the sale of a building. It should mention that the entry would typically involve debiting both the Accumulated Depreciation account and the Building account, and crediting the Cash account and possibly recognizing a Gain or Loss on Sale.\n2. **Clarify the Role of Each Option**: The reasoning should provide a brief explanation of why each of the other options is incorrect or how they relate to the sale of a building. For instance, it could explain that while a debit to Accumulated Depreciation is necessary to remove the accumulated depreciation from the books, a debit to Gain is incorrect because gains are recorded as credits.\n3. **Correct Misleading Terminology**: The answer should correct the terminology used for Option C. Instead of saying ""Debit to Gain,"" it should clarify that gains are recorded as credits, which is a fundamental accounting principle.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the journal entry related to the sale of a building for cash.'}",B,"When a building is sold, the journal entry typically involves debiting the Accumulated Depreciation account to remove the accumulated depreciation associated with the building from the books.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) See ""Note 4—Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets."" Other Assets Included in ""Other assets"" on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to marketable securities restricted for longer than one year, the majority of which are attributable to collateral/.at ion of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; acquired intangible assets, net of amoi li/,ation; deferred costs; certain equity investments; and intellectual property rights, net of amort 173lion. Investments We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate lenn fixed income securities and AAA-raled money market funds. Such investments are included in ""Cash and cash equivalents,"" or ""Marketable securities"" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, classified as available-far-sale, and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in ""Accumulated other comprehensive income Rquity investments arc accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. The total of these investments in equity-method invcslees, including: identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax liabilities and goodwill is classified on our consolidated balance sheets as ""Other assets."" Our share of the inveslees' earnings or losses and amortisation of the related intangible assets, if any, is classified as ""Hquity-mclliod investment activity, net of tax"" on our consolidated statements of operations. Equity investments without readily detcnninable fair values for which we do not have the ability Co exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method, investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, distributions of earnings, and additional investments. l-xniily investments that have readily determinate fair values are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of lax, included in ""Accumulated other comprehensive loss."" We [>eriodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their cost are olhcr-lhan- tcmporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent lo hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Additionally, we assess whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amorli/ed cost basis. Factors considered include quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends: other publicly available information; implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities; other conditions that may affect the value of our investments; duration and severity of the decline in value; and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment. Long-Uved Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. 45 746 Part Nine Financial Planning and Working Capital Management bre13901_ch28_743-769 746 08/24/18 06:41 PM The assets are listed in declining order of liquidity. For example, the accountant lists first those assets that are most likely to be turned into cash in the near future. They include cash itself, marketable securities and receivables (that is, bills to be paid by the firm’s customers), and inventories of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods. These assets are all known as current assets. The remaining assets on the balance sheet consist of long-term, usually illiquid, assets such as warehouses, stores, fixtures, and vehicles. The balance sheet does not show up-to-date market values of these long-term assets. Instead, the accountant records the amount that each asset originally cost and deducts a fixed annual amount for depreciation of buildings, plant, and equipment. The balance sheet does not include all the company’s assets. Some of the most valuable ones are intangible, such as reputation, skilled management, and a well-trained labor force. Accountants are generally reluctant to record these assets in the balance sheet unless they can be readily identified and reasonably valued.1 Now look at the right-hand portion of Home Depot’s balance sheet, which shows where the money to buy the assets came from. The accountant starts by looking at the liabilities, that is, the money owed by the company. First come those liabilities that need to be paid off in the near future. These current liabilities include debts that are due to be repaid within the next year and payables (that is, amounts owed by the company to its suppliers). 1Home Depot’s balance sheet does include an entry for “goodwill.” This reflects the difference between the price paid to acquire a company and that company’s book value.

This demonstrates a solid understanding of the basic structure of a balance sheet.\n   - The explanation provided is clear and accurately describes the nature of owner\'s equity, emphasizing that it represents the residual interest in the company\'s assets after liabilities are deducted. This shows a good grasp of the relationship between assets, liabilities, and equity.\n\n2. **Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:**\n   - While the answer correctly identifies owner\'s equity as not being an asset, it could benefit from a more nuanced explanation of why owner\'s equity is categorized separately. The reasoning could elaborate on how equity is derived from the assets and liabilities, rather than simply stating it is part of the liabilities and equity section.\n   - The phrase ""part of the liabilities and equity section"" is misleading. Owner\'s equity is not a part of liabilities; it is a separate category on the balance sheet. This could confuse readers who may not have a strong background in accounting.\n   - The answer does not address the context of the question sufficiently. It could briefly mention that the question is asking for a classification of items on a balance sheet, which would help frame the reasoning more effectively.\n\n3. **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\n   - Clarify the relationship between assets, liabilities, and equity by stating that owner\'s equity is a separate category that reflects the owners\' claim on the assets after all liabilities have been settled. This would enhance the depth of the explanation.\n   - Rephrase the statement about owner\'s equity being part of the liabilities and equity section to clarify that it is distinct from liabilities. For example, it could state that owner\'s equity is a separate section that represents the owners\' residual interest in the company\'s assets.\n   - Consider adding a brief mention of how the other options (inventory, investments, cash) are classified as assets, which would reinforce the understanding of the differences between these categories.\n   - A concluding sentence summarizing the key point that owner\'s equity is not an asset would help reinforce the main takeaway for the reader. \n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would be more comprehensive and clearer, providing a better understanding of the concepts involved.'}",B,"Owner's equity represents the owner's claim on the assets of the business after all liabilities have been deducted.

        ",B-3,C,"Bonus depreciation is typically available for new assets, and a new delivery truck qualifies as such. Used assets and certain improvements do not qualify.","Depreciation As we learned in an earlier chapter, depreciationis the allocation of a plant asset’s cost to expense over its useful life. Depreciation distributes the asset’s cost over the time (life) the asset is used.Depreciation matches the expense against the revenue generated from using the asset to measure net income. Exhibit 9-4 illustrates this matchin g of revenues and depreciation expense for a $40,000 truck (numbers assumed). Account for depreciation 2 Delivery Truck Expenditures— Capital Expenditure or Expense?EXHIBIT 9-3 Capital Expenditure or Expense? EXHIBIT 9 3 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE: Debit an Asset Account Extraordinary repairs: Major engine or transmission overhaul Modification for new use Addition to storage capacity Increase the life of the asset EXPENSE: Debit Repairs and maintenance expense Ordinary repairs: Repair of transmission or engine Oil change, lubrication, and so on Replacement of tires or windshield Paint job Treating a capital expenditure as an expense, or vice versa, creates an accounting error. Suppose Greg’s Tunes replaces the engine in the truck. This would be an extraor- dinary repair because it increases the truck’s life. If the company expenses the cost by debiting Repair and maintenance expense rather than capitalizin g it (debiting the asset), the company would be making an accounting error. This error - overstates Repair and maintenance expenses. - understates net income. - understates Retained earnings. - understates the Equipment account (asset) on the balance sheet. Incorrectly capitalizing an expense creates the opposite error. Assume a minor repair, such as replacing the water pump on the truck, was incorrectly debited to the Asset account. The error would result in expenses being understated and net income being overstated. Additionally, the balance sheet would overstate the truck assets by the amount of the repair bill. Depreciation—Matching Expense with RevenueEXHIBIT 9-4 Depreciation Matching Expense with Revenue EXHIBIT 9 4 Match Annual revenue, $100,000 Annual depreciation expense, $8,000 All costs spent to ready an asset to perform its intended function are capitalized (debited to the asset account). All repairs that neither extend the asset’s life nor improve its efficiency are expensed. Key Takeaway Plant Assets and Intangibles 459 Causes of Depreciation All assets, except land, wear out as they are used. Gre g’s delivery truck can only go so many miles before it is worn out. As the truck is driven, this use is part of what causes depreciation. Additionally, physical factors, like a ge and weather, can cause depreciation of assets. Some assets, such as computers and software, may become obsolete before they wear out. An asset is obsolete when a newer asset can perform the job more efficiently. As a result, an asset’s useful life may be shorter than its physical life. In all cases, the asset’s cost is depreciated over its useful life. Now that we have discussed causes of depreciation, let ’s itemize what depreciation is not. 1. Depreciation is not a process of valuation. Businesses do not record depreci- ation based on chan ges in the asset ’s market (sales) value. Depreciation is recapturing the cost invested in the asset. 2. Depreciation does not mean that the business sets aside cash to replace an asset when it is used up. Depreciation has nothing to do with cash. Measuring Depreciation Depreciation of a plant asset is based on three main factors: 1. Capitalized cost 2. Estimated useful life 3. Estimated residual value Capitalized cost is a known cost and, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, includes all items spent for the asset to perform its intended function. The other two factors are estimates. Estimated useful life is the length of the service period expected from the asset. The estimated useful life is how long the company expects it can use the asset. Useful life may be expressed in years, units, output, or miles. For each asset, the goal is to define the estimated useful life with the measure (years, units, etc.) that best mimics the asset’s decline or use. For example, a building’s life is stated in years, a truck’s in the number of miles it can drive, and a copier’s in the number of copies it can make. Estimated residual value—also called salvage value—is the asset’ s expected cash value at the end of its useful life. A delivery truck ’s useful life may be 100,000 miles. When the truck has been driven that distance, the company will sell or scrap it. The expected cash receipt at the end of the truck’s life is the truck’ s estimated residual value. Estimated residual value is not depreciated because you expect to receive this amount at the end. Cost minus estimated resid- ual value is called depreciable cost. Depreciation Methods There are many depreciation methods for plant assets, but three are used most commonly: - Straight-line - Units-of-production - Declining-balance Depreciable cost = Cost - Estimated residual value Plant Assets and Intangibles 495 /H17033Communication Activity 9-1 In 25 words or fewer, explain the depreciable cost used for each of the three methods. Your explanation should identify which methods calculate depreciable base the same way.

This is a key aspect of the tax code that the respondent has accurately recognized.\n2. **Specific Example**: The choice of a ""new delivery truck"" as an example of an asset that qualifies for bonus depreciation is appropriate and relevant, as it aligns with the criteria for new property under the tax law.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in the Logic:\n1. **Oversimplification of Eligibility Criteria**: The reasoning states that ""used assets and certain improvements do not qualify,"" which is an oversimplification. While it is true that bonus depreciation primarily applies to new assets, there are specific circumstances under which used assets can qualify, particularly if they are acquired after September 27, 2017, and meet certain criteria. This nuance is missing from the answer.\n2. **Lack of Consideration for Other Options**: The reasoning does not address the other options (A, B, and D) at all. A more thorough analysis would include a brief explanation of why each of the other options does not qualify for bonus depreciation, which would strengthen the overall argument and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n3. **No Mention of Recent Tax Law Changes**: The answer does not reference any recent changes in tax law that may affect the eligibility of certain assets for bonus depreciation, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which expanded the scope of bonus depreciation. This omission could lead to an incomplete understanding of the current tax landscape.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Expand on the Criteria for Used Assets**: Include a brief explanation of the conditions under which used assets can qualify for bonus depreciation. This would provide a more nuanced understanding and demonstrate a deeper grasp of the topic.\n2. **Analyze All Options**: Provide reasoning for each of the options presented in the question. For example, explain why used office machinery (A) and used office furniture (D) do not qualify, and clarify the status of qualified leasehold improvements (B) in relation to bonus depreciation.\n3. **Incorporate Relevant Tax Law Context**: Mention any relevant tax law changes that impact bonus depreciation eligibility, particularly those from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This would enhance the answer\'s relevance and accuracy.\n4. **Clarify the Definition of Qualified Leasehold Improvements**: If option B is mentioned, it would be beneficial to clarify what constitutes qualified leasehold improvements and why they may or may not qualify for bonus depreciation, as this is a common area of confusion.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would be more comprehensive, accurate, and informative.'}",C,"Bonus depreciation is available for new and used property, but it is particularly emphasized for new property. Among the options provided, a new delivery truck (C) qualifies for bonus depreciation as it is a new asset.

Before launchin g into the account- ing, let’s define the special terms used for notes receivable: - Promissory note: A written promise to pay a specified amount of money at a par- ticular future date. - Maker of the note (debtor): The entity that signs the note and promises to pay the required amount; the maker of the note is the debtor. The debtor is the company that must pay the money back. - Payee of the note (creditor): The entity to whom the maker promises future payment; the payee of the note is the creditor.The creditor is the company that loans the money. - Principal: The amount loaned out by the payee and borrowed by the maker of the note. - Interest: The revenue to the payee for loanin g money. Interest is expense to the debtor and revenue to the creditor. - Interest period: The period of time during which interest is computed. It extends from the original date of the note to the maturity date. Also called the note term. - Interest rate: The percentage rate of interest specified by the note. Interest rates are almost always stated for a period of one year. A 9% note means that the amount of interest for one year is 9% of the note’s principal. - Maturity date: As stated earlier, this is the date when final payment of the note is due. Also called the due date. - Maturity value: The sum of the principal plus interest due at maturity. Maturity value is the total amount that will be paid back.

Decreases in equity that result from dividends are debited to the Dividends account (or, alternately, recorded directly to Retained earnings, as shown in later chapters of this textbook), so we debit Dividends. CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 639 implications of transactions. For example, if goods are sold now, with payment due in 60 days, the income statement will treat the revenue as generated when the sale occurs, and the balance sheet will be immediately augmented by accounts receivable, but the statement of cash flows will not show an increase in available cash until the bill is paid. Table 19.3 is the statement of cash flows for HD. The first entry listed under cash provided by operations is net income. The next entries modify that figure for components of income that have been recognized but for which cash has not yet changed hands. For example, HD’s accounts receivable increased by $170 million. This portion of sales was claimed on the income statement, but the cash had not yet been collected. Increases in accounts receivable are in effect an investment in working capital, and therefore reduce the cash flows realized from operations. Similarly, increases in accounts payable mean that expenses have been recognized, but cash has not yet left the firm. Any payment delay increases the company’s net cash flows in this period. Another major difference between the income statement and the statement of cash flows involves depreciation, which is a major addition to income in the adjustment section of the statement of cash flows in Table 19.3 . The income statement attempts to “smooth” large capital expenditures over time. The depreciation expense on the income statement does this by recognizing such expenditures over a period of many years rather than at the specific time of purchase. In contrast, the statement of cash flows recognizes the cash implication of a capital expenditure when it occurs. Therefore, it adds back the depreciation “expense” Source: Home Depot Annual Report, year ending January 2012. $ Million Cash provided by operations Net income $ 3,883 Adjustments to net income Depreciation 1,682 Changes in working capital Decrease (increase) in receivables (170) Decrease (increase) in inventories 256 Increase (decrease) in other current liabilities 405 Changes due to other operating activities 595 Total adjustments $ 2,768 Cash provided by operations 6,651 Cash flows from investments Gross investment in tangible fixed assets $(1,221) Investments in other assets 92 Cash provided by (used for) investments $(1,129) Cash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities Additions to (reductions in) long-term debt $ 966 Net issues (repurchases of) shares (3,164) Dividends (1,632) Other (218) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $(4,048) Net increase in cash $ 1,474 Table 19.3 Statement of cash flows for Home Depot bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 639bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 639 7/17/13 4:12 PM7/17/13 4:12 PM","{'answer': '1. **Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning:**\n   - The initial answer correctly identifies ""C) Realization"" as the appropriate choice, which is accurate in the context of accounting terminology.\n   - The reasoning provided effectively explains the concept of realization, linking it to the process of converting noncash items into cash, specifically through the example of collecting accounts receivable.

Key Takeaway CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 637 In fact, the net income figure on the firm’s income statement does convey considerable information concerning a firm’s prospects. We see this in the fact that stock prices tend to increase when firms announce earnings greater than market analysts or investors had anticipated. The Balance Sheet While the income statement provides a measure of profitability over a period of time, the balance sheet provides a “snapshot” of the financial condition of the firm at a particular moment. The balance sheet is a list of the firm’s assets and liabilities at that moment. The difference in assets and liabilities is the net worth of the firm, also called shareholders’ or stockholders’ equity. Like income statements, balance sheets are reasonably standardized in presentation. Table 19.2 is HD’s balance sheet. The first section of the balance sheet gives a listing of the assets of the firm. Current assets are presented first. These are cash and other items such as accounts receivable or inventories that will be converted into cash within 1 year. Next comes a listing of long-term or “fixed” assets. Tangible fixed assets are items such as buildings, equipment, or vehicles. HD also has several intangible assets such as a respected brand name and expertise. But accountants generally are reluctant to include these assets on the balance sheet, as they are so hard to value. However, when one firm purchases another for a premium over its book value, that difference, called “goodwill,” is listed on the balance sheet as an intangible fixed asset. HD lists goodwill at $1,120 million. 1 The sum of current and fixed assets is total assets, the last line of the assets section of the balance sheet. The liability and shareholders’ equity (also called stockholders’ equity) section is arranged similarly. First come short-term, or “current,” liabilities such as accounts pay- able, accrued taxes, and debts that are due within 1 year. Following this is long-term debt and other liabilities due in more than 1 year. The difference between total assets and total liabilities is stockholders’ equity. This is the net worth, or book value, of the firm. Stock- holders’ equity is divided into par value of stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, although this division is usually unimportant. Briefly, par value plus additional paid-in capital represent the proceeds realized from the sale of stock to the public, whereas retained earnings represent the buildup of equity from profits plowed back into the firm. Even if the firm issues no new equity, book value typically will increase each year due to reinvested earnings. The entries in the left columns of the balance sheet in Table 19.2 present the dollar value of each asset. Just as they compute common-size income statements, however, ana- lysts also find it convenient to use common-size balance sheets when comparing firms of different sizes. Each item is expressed as a percentage of total assets. These entries appear in the right columns of Table 19.2 . The Statement of Cash Flows The income statement and balance sheets are based on accrual methods of accounting, which means that revenues and expenses are recognized at the time of a sale even if no cash has yet been exchanged. In contrast, the statement of cash flows tracks the cash 1 Firms are required to test their goodwill assets for “impairment” each year. If the value of the acquired firm is clearly less than its purchase price, that amount must be charged off as an expense. For example, in 2012 Hewlett- Packard wrote off $8.8 billion on its earlier purchase of the software company Autonomy Corp. amid charges that Autonomy had overstated its profitability prior to the purchase. AOL Time Warner set a record when it recognized an impairment of $99 billion in 2002 following the January 2001 merger of Time Warner with AOL. bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 637bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 637 7/17/13 4:12 PM7/17/13 4:12 PM 746 Part Nine Financial Planning and Working Capital Management bre13901_ch28_743-769 746 08/24/18 06:41 PM The assets are listed in declining order of liquidity. For example, the accountant lists first those assets that are most likely to be turned into cash in the near future. They include cash itself, marketable securities and receivables (that is, bills to be paid by the firm’s customers), and inventories of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods. These assets are all known as current assets. The remaining assets on the balance sheet consist of long-term, usually illiquid, assets such as warehouses, stores, fixtures, and vehicles. The balance sheet does not show up-to-date market values of these long-term assets. Instead, the accountant records the amount that each asset originally cost and deducts a fixed annual amount for depreciation of buildings, plant, and equipment. The balance sheet does not include all the company’s assets. Some of the most valuable ones are intangible, such as reputation, skilled management, and a well-trained labor force. Accountants are generally reluctant to record these assets in the balance sheet unless they can be readily identified and reasonably valued.1 Now look at the right-hand portion of Home Depot’s balance sheet, which shows where the money to buy the assets came from. The accountant starts by looking at the liabilities, that is, the money owed by the company. First come those liabilities that need to be paid off in the near future. These current liabilities include debts that are due to be repaid within the next year and payables (that is, amounts owed by the company to its suppliers). 1Home Depot’s balance sheet does include an entry for “goodwill.” This reflects the difference between the price paid to acquire a company and that company’s book value.

It effectively outlines the nature of current assets and their expected liquidity, which is essential for understanding their role in financial reporting.\n\n3. **Standard Practice Reference**: The mention that this classification is standard in financial reporting adds credibility to the answer. It suggests that the respondent is aware of the broader context of accounting practices.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in Logic:\n1. **Lack of Depth**: While the answer identifies the correct subsections, it lacks depth in discussing why these classifications are important. For instance, it could elaborate on how these classifications affect financial analysis or decision-making.\n\n2. **Absence of Contextual Evidence**: The phrase ""as indicated in the provided evidence"" is vague and does not specify what evidence is being referred to.

While the question specifically asks for subsections, acknowledging the existence of other categories could provide a more comprehensive understanding.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Expand on Importance**: The reasoning could be improved by discussing the significance of the classification of assets. For example, explaining how current assets are crucial for assessing liquidity and how property, plant, and equipment are vital for understanding long-term financial health would enhance the answer.\n\n2. **Cite Specific Standards or Guidelines**: Instead of a vague reference to ""provided evidence,"" the answer should cite specific accounting standards (e.g., GAAP or IFRS) or textbooks that outline the structure of a classified balance sheet. This would strengthen the credibility of the response.\n\n3. **Acknowledge Other Categories**: While the focus should remain on the two identified subsections, briefly mentioning other asset categories could provide a more rounded perspective. This could be done in a way that emphasizes their lesser relevance to the question while still acknowledging their existence.\n\n4. **Clarify Terminology**: The term ""long-term assets"" could be clarified further. While it is commonly understood, explicitly stating that property, plant, and equipment are typically classified as non-current assets would enhance clarity and precision.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would not only be more robust but also provide a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the classified balance sheet\'s asset subsections.'}",A,"A classified balance sheet typically categorizes assets into current assets and non-current assets, which include property, plant, and equipment.

        ",B-3,D,"The ratio that measures the profit earned on each dollar invested in a firm is the Return on Total Assets (ROA). This ratio indicates how effectively a company is using its assets to generate earnings. The evidence provided states that the rate of return on total assets is calculated as net income plus interest expense divided by average total assets, which directly relates to measuring profitability in relation to total investments.","CHAPTER 19 Financial Statement Analysis 649 Turnover and Other Asset Utilization Ratios It is often helpful in understanding a firm’s ratio of sales to assets to compute comparable efficiency-of-utilization, or turnover, ratios for subcategories of assets. For example, we can think about turnover relative to fixed rather than total assets: Fixed-asset turnover 5 Sales Fixed assets This ratio measures sales per dollar of the firm’s money tied up in fixed assets. To illustrate how you can compute this and other ratios from a firm’s financial state- ments, consider Growth Industries, Inc. (GI).

Our next task is to probe a little deeper to understand the reasons for the company’s success. What factors contribute to a firm’s overall profitability? One factor clearly must be the efficiency with which it uses its various assets. Asset Turnover Ratio The asset turnover, or sales-to-assets, ratio shows how much sales vol- ume is generated by each dollar of total assets, and therefore it measures how hard the firm’s assets are working. For Home Depot, each dollar of assets produced $2.35 of sales: Asset turnover = sales _____________________ total assets at start of year = 100,978 _______ 42,966 = 2.35 Technical note: Like a number of other financial ratios, the sales-to-assets ratio compares a flow measure (sales over the entire year) with a snapshot measure (assets at a point in time). But which point in time should you use? We calculated the ratio of Home Depot’s sales to assets at the start of the year, but frequently analysts use the average of the firm’s assets at the start and end of the year. The idea is that this better measures the assets that the firm had to work with assets during the year.11 In the case of Home Depot, the two ratios are effectively identical: Asset turnover = sales ________________ average total assets = 100,978 _________________ (44,529 + 42,966) / 2 = 2.31 There is no obvious best measure. If assets are turned over very slowly, it may be better to use the value at the start of the year; if they are turned over fast, as is often the case, it may be pref- erable to use the average measure. However, it’s probably not worth getting too steamed up over the matter. After all, both measures rest on the doubtful assumption that the asset levels at the close of each financial year are typical of the rest of the year. But, like many retailers, Home Depot ends its financial year in January/February just after the busy holiday season, when inventories and receivables are unusually low. The asset turnover ratio measures how efficiently the business is using its entire asset base. But you also might be interested in how hard particular types of assets are being put to use. Here are a couple of examples. Inventory Turnover Efficient firms don’t tie up more capital than they need in raw materi - als and finished goods. They hold only a relatively small level of inventories, and they turn over those inventories rapidly. The balance sheet shows the cost of inventories rather than the amount that the finished goods will eventually sell for. So it is usual to compare the level of inventories with the cost of goods sold rather than with sales. In Home Depot’s case, Inventory turnover = cost of goods sold ____________________ inventory at start of year = 66,548 ______ 12,549 = 5.3 Another way to express this measure is to look at how many days of output are represented by inventories. This is equal to the level of inventories divided by the daily cost of goods sold: Inventory period = inventory at start of year ____________________ daily cost of goods sold = 12,549 __________ 66,548 / 365 = 69 days Receivables Turnover Receivables are sales for which the company has not yet been paid. The receivables turnover ratio measures the firm’s sales as a proportion of its receivables. For Home Depot, Receivables turnover = sales ______________________ receivables at start of year = 100, 978 _______ 2, 029 = 49.8 11Sometimes it is convenient to use a snapshot figure at the end of the year, although this is not strictly appropriate.

While ROA is relevant, it is not the most precise answer to this question. The more appropriate ratio for measuring profit per dollar invested is ""Return on Equity"" (ROE) or ""Return on Investment"" (ROI), depending on the context. ROA measures the efficiency of asset use rather than direct profit per dollar invested.\n   - The answer does not address the other options provided in the question, which could lead to confusion about why ROA is the best choice among them. A brief comparison or dismissal of the other options would strengthen the argument.\n   - The explanation could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concept of ""profit earned on each dollar invested,"" as the current reasoning focuses more on asset utilization rather than direct profit measurement.\n\n3. **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\n   - Clarify the distinction between ROA and other relevant ratios like ROE or ROI, and explain why ROA is chosen over these alternatives. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n   - Include a brief analysis of the other answer choices (Current ratio, Asset turnover, Return on sales) to demonstrate why they are not suitable for measuring profit per dollar invested. This would enhance the depth of the reasoning.\n   - Rephrase the initial reasoning to directly address the question\'s focus on profit per dollar invested, ensuring that the explanation aligns more closely with the specific terminology used in the question.\n   - Consider providing examples or scenarios where ROA is particularly useful, which could help contextualize the ratio\'s application in real-world situations.'}",D,"The ratio that measures the profit earned on each dollar invested in a firm is known as Return on Total Assets (ROTA).

This clarity is essential in answering multiple-choice questions.\n\n2. **Logical Justification**: The reasoning provided effectively explains why company cars are not considered a major asset for Brick & Mortar retailers. It correctly identifies the primary assets as people, inventory, and real estate, which are indeed critical for retail operations.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: The answer demonstrates an understanding of the retail business model by distinguishing between essential assets and those that are supplementary. This shows a grasp of the operational needs of Brick & Mortar retailers.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in Logic\n\n1. **Lack of Depth**: While the answer identifies company cars as non-essential, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of why they are not considered a major asset. For instance, discussing the varying importance of transportation in different retail contexts (e.g., delivery services vs. in-store sales) could provide a more nuanced view.\n\n2. **Assumption of Universality**: The reasoning assumes that all Brick & Mortar retailers operate under the same model. However, some retailers may indeed rely on company cars for logistics, especially those that offer delivery services. This oversight could mislead readers into thinking that company cars are universally unimportant.\n\n3. **Lack of Examples**: The answer could be strengthened by providing examples of retail businesses that do or do not use company cars. This would help illustrate the point and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Expand on the Role of Company Cars**: Include a brief discussion on scenarios where company cars might be relevant to certain types of retailers. This would acknowledge the complexity of retail operations and provide a more balanced perspective.\n\n2. **Incorporate Examples**: Adding specific examples of different types of Brick & Mortar retailers (e.g., grocery stores, clothing retailers, furniture stores) and their asset needs could enhance the answer\'s credibility and relatability.\n\n3. **Clarify the Definition of Major Assets**: It would be beneficial to define what constitutes a ""major asset"" in the context of retail. This could help clarify why people, inventory, and real estate are prioritized over company cars.\n\n4. **Consider Variability in Retail Models**: Acknowledge that the importance of assets can vary based on the business model. For instance, a retailer that offers delivery services may view company cars as a significant investment, while a traditional storefront may not.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer could provide a more comprehensive and insightful evaluation of the assets necessary for Brick & Mortar retailers.'}",C,"Company cars are not typically considered a major asset for brick-and-mortar retailers.

He can sell the training materials around neighboring colleges and help develop an online marketing plan for new DVDs. In addition, he will also be doing the company’s accounting. With boxes of DVDs crammed into every corner, Smart Touch’s current office space is getting outgrown. Sheena will need to rent warehouse space or buy another building. Expansion will bring a new set of challenges: - How will Sheena safeguard Smart Touch’s assets? - How will she ensure that Andrew follows policies that are best for the business? Internal Control A key responsibility of a business manager is to control operations. Owners set goals, hire managers to lead the way, and hire employees to carry out the business plan. Internal control is the organizational plan and all the related measures desig ned to accomplish the following: 1. Safeguard assets. A company must protect its assets; otherwise it is throwin g away resources. If you fail to safeguard your cash, the most liquid of assets, it will quickly slip away. 2. Encourage employees to follow company policy. Everyone in an organization needs to work toward the same goals. With Sheena’ s brother, Andrew, operat- ing part of Smart Touch, it is important for the business to identify policies to help meet the company’s goals. These policies are also important for the com- pany to ensure that all customers are treated similarly, and that results can be measured effectively. 3. P romote oper ational efficiency. Businesses cannot afford to waste resources. Sheena and Andrew work hard to make sales for Smart Touch and do not want to waste any of the benefits. If Smart Touch can buy a particular training DVD for $3, why pay $ 4? Promoting operational efficiency reduces expenses and increases business profits. 4. Ensur e accur ate, reliable accounting r ecords. Accurate, reliable accountin g records are essential. Without reliable records, managers cannot tell which part of the business is profitable and which part needs improvement. Smart Touch could be losing money on every DVD sold and not realize it—unless it keeps good records for the cost of its products. Define internal control 1 Stop Think... Internal controls do not only apply to “big business.” We do things every day that mirror the four internal control measures defined previously. Consider your car, for example. You always lock the doors and you buy gas at the station with the lowest price per gallon. How do these personal acts relate to an internal control plan? Locking the door is an example of safeguarding assets. Finding the lowest price per gallon for gas is an example of operational efficiency. How critical are internal controls? They are so important that the U.S. Congress passed a law requiring public companies—those that sell their stock to the general public—to maintain a system of internal controls. This chapter presents a framework for dealin g with these issues. It also shows how to account for cash, the most liquid of all assets. Internal control systems are the rules and boundaries that help protect what the company owns, ensure that the company is operating efficiently within those rules, and ensure that the accounting reports accurately show transactions that have occurred. Key Takeaway Other Controls The types of other controls are as endless as the types of businesses that exist. Some examples of other common controls are - fireproof vaults to store important documents; - burglar alarms, fire alarms, and security cameras; and - loss-prevention specialists who train company employees to spot suspicious activity. As another control, fidelity bonds are purchased for employees who handle cash. The bond is an insurance policy that reimburses the company for any losses due to employee theft. Mandatory vacations and job rotation improve internal control. These controls also improve morale by giving employees a broad view of the business. Internal Controls for E-Commerce E-commerce creates its own unique types of risks. Hackers may gain access to con- fidential information, such as account numbers and passwords, or may introduce computer viruses, Trojans, or phishing expeditions. Stolen Account Numbers or Passwords Suppose you buy CDs from Greg’ s Tunes’ online store. To make the purchase, you must create an online account with a password for the site. When you submit your purchase, your credit card number must travel through the Internet, potentially exposing it, your account, and password information. Additionally, wireless (Wi-Fi) networks are creating new security hazards. Accessing unsecured Wi-Fi networks exposes the computer and consequently the company’s data to the potential for net- work attacks and viruses. For example, in 2008, Heartland Payment Systems, a provider of credit and debit card processing services, had its network security system breached. Over 100 million cards were potentially compromised. Heartland reported expenses related to the breach of$139.4 million and insurance recoveries related to the breach of only $30.7 million through March 31, 2010. Computer Viruses and Trojans A computer virus is a malicious program that (a) enters program code without con- sent and (b) performs destructive actions. A Trojan hides inside a leg itimate pro- gram and works like a virus. Both can destroy or alter data, make bog us calculations, and infect files. (This, of course, is a risk to any business usin g the Internet.) Most firms have found a virus at some point in time in their system. Suppose an individual plants a virus into your school’ s computer that changes all the grades for students for a semester. This type of virus or Trojan could under- mine not only a grade, but a school’s reputation, to say the least. Phishing Expeditions Thieves phish by creating bog us Web sites, such as AOL4Free.com. The neat- sounding Web site attracts lots of visitors, and the thieves obtain account numbers and passwords from unsuspecting people who use the bogus site. They then use the data for illicit purposes. Explain control pro- cedures unique to e-commerce 4 Internal control procedures include hiring competent, reliable, and ethical personnel; assigning responsibility for various tasks so accountability may occur; separating key duties so that one person doesn’t have access, recording, and authorization functions; performing internal and external audits; and pre-numbering documents sequentially. The key to each of these controls is that the cost of the control should not exceed the benefit (savings) from implementing the control. Key Takeaway and CDs. Businesses that sell a product are called merchandisers because they sell merchandise, or goods, to customers. In this chapter, we’ll introduce accounting for merchandisers, showing how to account for the purchase and sale of inventory, the additional current asset that merchandisers have. Inventory is defined as the merchandise that a company holds for sale to cus- tomers. For example, Greg’s Tunes must hold some CD inventory in order to operate. Walmart carries food inventory in addition to clothing, housewares, and school sup- plies. A Hondadealer holds inventories of automobiles and auto parts. In this chapter, Smart Touch has decided to discontinue its service business and instead plans to sell tutorial CDs and DVDs that it purchases from a vendor. With its change in business strategy, Smart Touch is now considered a merchandiser. By continuing the same company with a different business strategy in the examples, we will give you a basis for comparison between service and merchandising businesses. We’ll also cover examples usin g Greg’s Tunes. Let’s get started by looking at some basics of merchandising operations. What Are Merchandising Operations?

This helps establish a solid foundation for evaluating the options.\n\n2. **Direct Connection to the Answer**: The reasoning effectively connects option A (attaching electronic sensors to merchandise inventory) to the concept of safeguarding assets. It explains how this action directly contributes to preventing theft and securing inventory, which is a relevant and practical example.\n\n3. **Elimination of Irrelevant Options**: The answer correctly identifies that the other options (B, C, and D) do not directly relate to safeguarding assets. This demonstrates an understanding of the specific focus of the question.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in Logic\n\n1. **Lack of Depth in Analysis**: While the answer identifies option A as correct, it could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of why the other options are not representative of safeguarding assets. For instance, a brief explanation of why reducing expenses or allowing accountants to handle cash does not relate to asset protection would strengthen the argument.\n\n2. **Assumption of Knowledge**: The reasoning assumes that the reader has a clear understanding of what constitutes safeguarding assets without providing examples or context for the other options. This could leave some readers confused about why those options are not valid.\n\n3. **Limited Scope of Safeguarding**: The answer focuses solely on theft prevention through electronic sensors. Safeguarding assets can also include other measures such as insurance, physical security, and employee training. Acknowledging this broader scope could enhance the reasoning.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Expand on Other Options**: Include a brief explanation of why options B, C, and D do not qualify as safeguarding assets. For example, option B could be described as a financial strategy rather than a protective measure, while option D could be critiqued for potentially increasing risk rather than safeguarding.\n\n2. **Broaden the Definition**: Consider expanding the definition of safeguarding assets to include various methods beyond electronic sensors. This could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the concept and its applications.\n\n3. **Use Examples**: Incorporate additional examples of safeguarding measures to illustrate the concept further. This could help readers grasp the various ways companies protect their assets beyond just inventory.\n\n4. **Clarify the Focus**: Reiterate that the question specifically asks for actions that safeguard assets, which may help reinforce the reasoning and ensure clarity in the argument.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer could become more robust and informative, providing a clearer understanding of the concept of safeguarding assets.'}",A,"Attaching electronic sensors to merchandise inventory is a direct method of safeguarding assets.

An independent appraisal valued the land at $338,625 and the communication equipment at $112,875. Sold a building that cost $560,400 (accumulated depreciation of $260,000 throughDecember 31 of the preceding year). Carr received $390,000 cash from the sale of the building. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis. The building has a 40-year useful life and a residual value of $90,000. Recorded depreciation as follows: Communication equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over a five-year life with zero residual value. Office equipment is depreciated using the double-declining-balance over five years with $1,000 residual value.

The owner then has two choices: - Trade the asset for non-like property. This choice includes selling or scrapping the asset, or trading for an asset that is not similar in functionality. Examples include selling a truck for cash, scrapping a truck for no cash, or tradin g a truck for equipment. All are non-like property exchanges and a gain or loss on the trans- action must be recognized by the company. - Trade the asset for another asset that has similar functionality. This is called a non- monetary or like-kind exchange. The basic principle for like-kind exchanges is to value the asset received at its fair value, if it is more clearly evident. Fair value is either the fair value of the asset(s) given up OR the fair value of the asset(s) received plus/minus any cash received/paid in the transaction. An example of a non-monetary asset exchange would be trading a Ford truck for a Toyotatruck. Regardless of the type of exchang e (like or non-like kind property), the four steps for journalizing disposals or trades are similar and are as follows: 1. Bring the depreciation up to date. 2. Remove the old, disposed of asset from the books. a. Make the Asset account equal zero by crediting the asset for its original cost. b. Make the Accumulated depreciation account for the asset equal zero by debiting it for all the depreciation taken to date on the asset. 3. Record the value of any cash (or other accounts) paid (or received) for the asset. For example, if cash is given, credit Cash. If cash is received, debit Cash. If a note payable was signed, credit Notes payable. 4. Finally, determine the difference between the total debits and total credits made in the journal entry. a. If the asset was traded for a like-kind asset and the fair value of neither asset is determinable, the net difference in debits and credits will be recorded as a debit to the new asset account.

This is a fundamental step in accounting and demonstrates an understanding of asset valuation.\n   - The calculation of the book value is accurate: $95,000 (original cost) - $90,000 (accumulated depreciation) = $5,000. This shows that the respondent has a grasp of the basic principles of depreciation and asset disposal.\n   - The conclusion that discarding the asset results in a loss equal to the book value is logically sound, as it aligns with accounting principles regarding asset disposal.\n\n2. **Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:**\n   - The answer does not explicitly mention that the loss is recognized because the asset is being discarded without any proceeds. While this is implied, a clearer explanation would strengthen the reasoning.\n   - The answer could benefit from a brief discussion of the implications of recognizing a loss on the financial statements, such as how it affects net income or equity. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the consequences of the action.\n   - The answer does not address the potential for any additional costs or considerations related to the disposal of the asset, such as removal costs or environmental fees, which could further impact the financial outcome.\n\n3. **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\n   - Enhance the explanation by explicitly stating that the loss arises from the fact that the asset is discarded without any cash inflow. This would clarify the reasoning for readers who may not be familiar with the concept.\n   - Include a brief note on how this loss would be reflected in the financial statements, such as its impact on net income or how it would be recorded in the accounting records. This would provide a more holistic view of the situation.\n   - Consider mentioning any potential additional costs associated with the disposal of the asset, as this could affect the overall financial outcome. Acknowledging these factors would demonstrate a deeper understanding of asset management and disposal processes.\n   - Finally, it would be beneficial to explicitly state that the correct answer is A) a loss of $5,000, reinforcing the conclusion drawn from the calculations.

The asset Cash has increased, and the asset Accounts receivable has decreased. Remember, Accounts receivable is a list of customers from whom the busi- ness will receive money. When the business receives these payments from its customers, the amount of this account decreases, because the business now has less to receive in the future (in this case, it reduces from $2,600—in transaction d—to $500).

For example, if goods are sold now, with payment due in 60 days, the income statement will treat the revenue as generated when the sale occurs, and the balance sheet will be immediately augmented by accounts receivable, but the statement of cash flows will not show an increase in available cash until the bill is paid. Table 19.3 is the statement of cash flows for HD. The first entry listed under cash provided by operations is net income. The next entries modify that figure for components of income that have been recognized but for which cash has not yet changed hands. For example, HD’s accounts receivable increased by $170 million. This portion of sales was claimed on the income statement, but the cash had not yet been collected. Increases in accounts receivable are in effect an investment in working capital, and therefore reduce the cash flows realized from operations. Similarly, increases in accounts payable mean that expenses have been recognized, but cash has not yet left the firm. Any payment delay increases the company’s net cash flows in this period. Another major difference between the income statement and the statement of cash flows involves depreciation, which is a major addition to income in the adjustment section of the statement of cash flows in Table 19.3 . The income statement attempts to “smooth” large capital expenditures over time. The depreciation expense on the income statement does this by recognizing such expenditures over a period of many years rather than at the specific time of purchase. In contrast, the statement of cash flows recognizes the cash implication of a capital expenditure when it occurs. Therefore, it adds back the depreciation “expense” Source: Home Depot Annual Report, year ending January 2012. $ Million Cash provided by operations Net income $ 3,883 Adjustments to net income Depreciation 1,682 Changes in working capital Decrease (increase) in receivables (170) Decrease (increase) in inventories 256 Increase (decrease) in other current liabilities 405 Changes due to other operating activities 595 Total adjustments $ 2,768 Cash provided by operations 6,651 Cash flows from investments Gross investment in tangible fixed assets $(1,221) Investments in other assets 92 Cash provided by (used for) investments $(1,129) Cash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities Additions to (reductions in) long-term debt $ 966 Net issues (repurchases of) shares (3,164) Dividends (1,632) Other (218) Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $(4,048) Net increase in cash $ 1,474 Table 19.3 Statement of cash flows for Home Depot bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 639bod61671_ch19_635-677.indd 639 7/17/13 4:12 PM7/17/13 4:12 PM Transaction 8 Sheena Bright remodeled her home with personal funds.

This demonstrates a solid understanding of basic accounting principles regarding asset transactions.\n   - The explanation clearly articulates the concept of double-entry accounting, where one asset increases while another decreases, leading to no net change in total assets. This is a fundamental principle in accounting that is well-explained in the reasoning.\n\n2. **Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:**\n   - While the answer correctly concludes that total assets remain the same, it could benefit from a more explicit mention of the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity) to reinforce the reasoning. This would provide a broader context for why total assets do not change.\n   - The answer does not address the implications for cash flow or the operational aspects of receiving cash, which could enhance the understanding of the transaction's impact beyond just the balance sheet.\n   - The answer could also clarify that while total assets remain unchanged, the composition of assets changes (i.e., cash increases while accounts receivable decreases). This distinction is important for a comprehensive understanding of asset management.\n\n3. **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\n   - Include a brief reference to the accounting equation to strengthen the explanation and provide a more holistic view of the transaction's impact on the financial statements.\n   - Discuss the implications of cash flow in relation to the transaction. For example, mention that while total assets remain the same, cash flow improves, which is a critical aspect of financial health.\n   - Clarify the change in asset composition by explicitly stating that while total assets are unchanged, the nature of the assets has shifted from accounts receivable to cash. This would provide a clearer picture of the transaction's effects.\n   - Consider providing a brief example or scenario to illustrate the concept further, which could help in solidifying the understanding of the transaction's impact on the financial statements.""}",D,"When cash is received in payment of an accounts receivable, the cash account (an asset) increases while the accounts receivable account (also an asset) decreases by the same amount.

For example, the accountant lists first those assets that are most likely to be turned into cash in the near future. They include cash itself, marketable securities and receivables (that is, bills to be paid by the firm’s customers), and inventories of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods. These assets are all known as current assets. The remaining assets on the balance sheet consist of long-term, usually illiquid, assets such as warehouses, stores, fixtures, and vehicles. The balance sheet does not show up-to-date market values of these long-term assets. Instead, the accountant records the amount that each asset originally cost and deducts a fixed annual amount for depreciation of buildings, plant, and equipment. The balance sheet does not include all the company’s assets. Some of the most valuable ones are intangible, such as reputation, skilled management, and a well-trained labor force. Accountants are generally reluctant to record these assets in the balance sheet unless they can be readily identified and reasonably valued.1 Now look at the right-hand portion of Home Depot’s balance sheet, which shows where the money to buy the assets came from. The accountant starts by looking at the liabilities, that is, the money owed by the company. First come those liabilities that need to be paid off in the near future. These current liabilities include debts that are due to be repaid within the next year and payables (that is, amounts owed by the company to its suppliers). 1Home Depot’s balance sheet does include an entry for “goodwill.” This reflects the difference between the price paid to acquire a company and that company’s book value.

This demonstrates a clear understanding of liquidity and its implications in asset management.\n   \n2. **Clear Explanation**: The reasoning provided is straightforward and effectively communicates why cash is considered the most liquid asset. The mention of immediate usability for transactions without conversion is a strong point that highlights the essence of liquidity.\n\n3. **Comparison with Other Options**: The answer appropriately contrasts cash with other options like accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, which adds depth to the reasoning. This comparative analysis helps reinforce the argument for cash being the most liquid.\n\n### Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:\n1. **Lack of Depth in Explanation**: While the answer states that cash is the most liquid asset, it could benefit from a more detailed explanation of why accounts receivable and prepaid expenses are less liquid. For instance, it could elaborate on the time and effort required to convert these assets into cash.\n\n2. **Missing Context on Liquidity**: The answer mentions that assets are listed in declining order of liquidity but does not provide any context or source for this claim. Including a reference to a financial principle or framework would strengthen the argument.\n\n3. **Overgeneralization**: The statement that ""assets are listed in declining order of liquidity"" is somewhat vague. It would be more effective to specify that this is a common convention in accounting and finance, as not all asset lists may follow this order.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Expand on Comparisons**: The reasoning could be improved by providing specific examples of how long it typically takes to convert accounts receivable and prepaid expenses into cash. This would give a clearer picture of their relative liquidity.\n\n2. **Cite Sources or Principles**: Including a reference to financial principles, such as the liquidity hierarchy or the accounting equation, would lend credibility to the argument. For example, mentioning that cash is at the top of the liquidity pyramid would provide a solid foundation for the claim.\n\n3. **Clarify Terminology**: The term ""liquid asset"" could be defined briefly in the answer to ensure clarity for readers who may not be familiar with financial terminology. This would enhance the educational value of the response.\n\n4. **Consider Alternative Perspectives**: While cash is universally recognized as the most liquid asset, acknowledging that liquidity can vary based on market conditions or specific contexts (e.g., economic downturns affecting accounts receivable) could provide a more nuanced view.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would not only be correct but also more comprehensive and informative.'}",D,"Cash is considered the most liquid asset because it can be used immediately for transactions without any conversion or delay.

        B) Accounts receivable, prepaid rent, accounts payable, unearned revenue
        C) Buildings, supplies, accounts receivable, owner's drawings
        D) Prepaid insurance, accounts receivable, unearned revenue, owner's capital
        ",B-3,D,"In option D, 'Prepaid insurance' and 'Accounts receivable' are both considered assets as they represent resources owned by the business. 'Unearned revenue' is a liability because it represents money received for services not yet performed, indicating an obligation to deliver goods or services in the future. 'Owner's capital' is classified as owner's equity, representing the owner's claim to the assets of the business. Therefore, this option correctly categorizes the accounts as required.","Accounting and the Business Environment 11 The Accounting Equation The basic tool of accounting is the accounting equation. It measures the resources of a business and the claims to those resources. Assets and Liabilities Assets are economic resources that are expected to benefit the business in the future. Assets are something the business owns that has value.Cash, merchandise inventory, furniture, and land are examples of assets. Claims to those assets come from two sources. Liabilities are debts payable to outsiders who are known as creditors. Liabilities are something the business owes. For example, a creditor who has loaned money to Smart Touch has a claim to some of the business’ s assets until the business pays the debt. Many liabilities have the word payable in their titles. Examples include Accounts payable, Notes payable, and Salary payable. The owners’ claims to the assets of the business are called equity (also called owners’, stockholders’, or shareholders’ equity). Equity equals what is owned (assets) minus what is owed (liabilities). It is the company’s net worth. Stockholders are the owners of the corporation, so owners equal stockholders and owners’ equity equals stockholders’ equity.These insider claims begin when a stockholder, such as Sheena Bright, invests assets in the business and receives the corporation’s stock. The accounting equation shows how assets, liabilities, and owners ’ equity are related. Assets appear on the left side of the equation, and the liabilities and owners’ equity appear on the right side. The accounting equation is an equation—so the left side of the equation always equals the right side of the equation. Exhibit 1-4 diag rams how the two sides must always be equal (amounts are assumed for this illustration): Describe the accounting equa- tion, and define assets, liabilities, and equity 7 = = (Economic Resources) ASSETS $5,000 (Claims to Economic Resources) LIABILITIES + EQUITY $2,000 + $3,000 The Accounting EquationEXHIBIT 1-4 The Accounting Equation EXHIBIT 1 4 Assets Liabilities Equity = + The Stable Monetary Unit Concept In the United States, we record transactions in dollars because the dollar is the medium of exchange. The value of a dollar changes over time, and a rise in the price level is called inflation. Durin g periods of inflation, a dollar will purchase less. But accountants assume that the dollar’s purchasing power is stable. This assumption is the basis of the stable monetar y unit concept. The stable monetary unit concept means stable currency buying power. Now that we’ve reviewed some of the basic concepts/assumptions underlyin g financial statements, we’ll cover the accounting equation. The accounting concepts are the underlying assumptions used when recording financial informa- tion for a business. Think of the concepts like rules of a game. You have to play by the rules.

The normal balance is the side of the T-account where the account INCREASES. Assets, Dividends, and Expenses have nor- mal debit balances. Liabilities, Equity, and Revenues have normal credit balances. - Recall that debits are listed first in every journal entry. - Remember debits ALWAYS EQUAL credits in every journal entry. - Keep in mind that posting is just gathering all the journal entries made to an individual T-account so that you can determine the new balance in the account. Journal debit entries are posted on the left side of the T-account. Journal credit entries are posted on the right side of the T-account. - The accounting equation MUST ALWAYS balance after each trans- action is posted. - The trial balance lists all accounts with a balance, ordered by assets, liabilities, equity, dividends, revenues, and expenses. Total debits should equal total credits on the trial balance.

In Chapter 6, we applied this principle to inventory. These costs vary, so let’s discuss each asset individually. Land and Land Improvements The cost of land is not depreciated. It includes the following costs paid by the purchaser: - Purchase price - Brokerage commission - Survey and legal fees - Property taxes in arrears - Taxes assessed to transfer the ownership (title) on the land - Cost of clearing the land and removing unwanted buildings The cost of land does not include the following costs: - Fencing - Paving - Sprinkler systems - Lighting - Signs These separate plant assets—called land impr ovements—are subject to depreciation. Suppose Smart Touch needs property and purchases land for $50,000 with a note payable for the same amount. Smart Touch also pays cash as follows: $4,000 in property taxes in arrears, $2,000 in transfer taxes, $5,000 to remove an old building, and a $1,000 survey fee. What is the company’s cost of this land? Exhibit 9-2 shows all the costs incurred to bring the land to its intended use: Suppose Smart Touch paid a combined purchase price of $ 100,000 on August 1, 2013, for the land and building. An appraisal performed a month before the purchase indicates that the land’s market (sales) value is $30,000 and the building’s market (sales) value is $90,000. It is clear that Smart Touch got a good deal, paying less than fair market value, which is $120,000 for the combined assets. But how will Smart Touch allocate the $100,000 paid for both assets? First, figure the ratio of each asset ’s market value to the total for both assets combined. The total appraised value is $120,000. Total price of land and a building $100,000 + What is the cost of the building? What is the cost of the land? ? ? =+$30,000 Land Market Value $90,000 Building Market Value $120,000 Total Market Value=+ The land makes up 25% of the total market value, and the building 75%, as follows: Land Building Total $ 30,000 90,000 $120,000 $30,000/$120,000 $90,000/$120,000 =2 5 % 75% 100% /H11003$100,000 100,000 = $ 25,000 75,000 $100,000 = /H11003 = Market (Sales) ValueAsset Percentage of Total Value Cost of Each Asset Total Purchase Price/H11003 = Furniture and Fixtures Furniture and fixtures include desks, chairs, file cabinets, display racks, shelvin g, and so forth. The cost of furniture and fixtures includes the basic cost of each asset (less any discounts), plus all other costs to ready the asset for its intended use. For example, for a desk, this may include the costs to ship the desk to the business and the cost paid to a laborer to assemble the desk. A Lump-Sum (Basket) Purchase of Assets A company may pay a sing le price for several assets as a g roup—a “basket pur- chase.” For example, Smart Touch may pay a sin gle price for land and a building . For accounting , the company must identify the cost of each asset, as shown in the following diag ram. The total cost paid (100%) is divided amon g the assets according to their relative sales or market values. This is called the relative-sales- value method. 8.

This is a fundamental concept in accounting and is accurately applied in this context.\n2. **Clarity of Explanation**: The reasoning is straightforward and clearly articulates why the asset should be recorded at $11,000. It effectively communicates the rationale behind the choice, making it easy for readers to understand the logic.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in the Logic:\n1. **Lack of Consideration for Other Factors**: While the cost principle is correctly cited, the answer does not address any potential exceptions or nuances that might apply in different contexts (e.g., impairment, fair value measurements in certain circumstances). This could lead to an incomplete understanding of asset valuation.\n2. **No Mention of Accounting Standards**: The reasoning could be strengthened by referencing relevant accounting standards (such as GAAP or IFRS) that support the cost principle. This would provide a more robust foundation for the argument.\n3. **Failure to Address the Other Options**: The answer does not explain why the other options (A, B, and D) are incorrect. A brief analysis of why these amounts do not align with the cost principle would enhance the answer's comprehensiveness.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Expand on the Cost Principle**: While the cost principle is correctly identified, the answer could benefit from a more detailed explanation of its implications and any exceptions. For instance, discussing scenarios where fair value might be considered could provide a more nuanced view.\n2. **Incorporate Accounting Standards**: Including references to specific accounting standards (like GAAP or IFRS) that govern asset valuation would lend credibility to the reasoning and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic.\n3. **Analyze Incorrect Options**: A brief discussion of why the other answer choices are incorrect would improve the answer's thoroughness. For example, explaining why $20,500 (market value) is not appropriate under the cost principle, or why $5,500 and $22,000 are not relevant, would provide a more complete analysis.\n4. **Consider Real-World Implications**: Mentioning how this principle applies in real-world scenarios or its importance in financial reporting could enhance the relevance of the answer and engage the reader more effectively.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would not only be correct but also more informative and comprehensive.""}",C,"In accounting, plant assets are recorded at their cost, which is the amount paid to acquire them.

        If the disposal of a plant asset occurs during the year, depreciation is:
        A) not recorded for the year
        B) recorded for the whole year
        C) not recorded if the asset is scrapped
        D) recorded for the fraction of the year to the date of the disposal
        ",B-3,D,"When a plant asset is disposed of during the year, depreciation is recorded only for the fraction of the year up to the date of disposal. This is because depreciation is meant to allocate the cost of the asset over its useful life, and if the asset is no longer in use, only the portion of the year it was in use should be accounted for.","Depreciation As we learned in an earlier chapter, depreciationis the allocation of a plant asset’s cost to expense over its useful life. Depreciation distributes the asset’s cost over the time (life) the asset is used.Depreciation matches the expense against the revenue generated from using the asset to measure net income. Exhibit 9-4 illustrates this matchin g of revenues and depreciation expense for a $40,000 truck (numbers assumed). Account for depreciation 2 Delivery Truck Expenditures— Capital Expenditure or Expense?EXHIBIT 9-3 Capital Expenditure or Expense? EXHIBIT 9 3 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE: Debit an Asset Account Extraordinary repairs: Major engine or transmission overhaul Modification for new use Addition to storage capacity Increase the life of the asset EXPENSE: Debit Repairs and maintenance expense Ordinary repairs: Repair of transmission or engine Oil change, lubrication, and so on Replacement of tires or windshield Paint job Treating a capital expenditure as an expense, or vice versa, creates an accounting error. Suppose Greg’s Tunes replaces the engine in the truck. This would be an extraor- dinary repair because it increases the truck’s life. If the company expenses the cost by debiting Repair and maintenance expense rather than capitalizin g it (debiting the asset), the company would be making an accounting error. This error - overstates Repair and maintenance expenses. - understates net income. - understates Retained earnings. - understates the Equipment account (asset) on the balance sheet. Incorrectly capitalizing an expense creates the opposite error. Assume a minor repair, such as replacing the water pump on the truck, was incorrectly debited to the Asset account. The error would result in expenses being understated and net income being overstated. Additionally, the balance sheet would overstate the truck assets by the amount of the repair bill. Depreciation—Matching Expense with RevenueEXHIBIT 9-4 Depreciation Matching Expense with Revenue EXHIBIT 9 4 Match Annual revenue, $100,000 Annual depreciation expense, $8,000 All costs spent to ready an asset to perform its intended function are capitalized (debited to the asset account). All repairs that neither extend the asset’s life nor improve its efficiency are expensed. Key Takeaway Plant Assets and Intangibles 459 Causes of Depreciation All assets, except land, wear out as they are used. Gre g’s delivery truck can only go so many miles before it is worn out. As the truck is driven, this use is part of what causes depreciation. Additionally, physical factors, like a ge and weather, can cause depreciation of assets. Some assets, such as computers and software, may become obsolete before they wear out. An asset is obsolete when a newer asset can perform the job more efficiently. As a result, an asset’s useful life may be shorter than its physical life. In all cases, the asset’s cost is depreciated over its useful life. Now that we have discussed causes of depreciation, let ’s itemize what depreciation is not. 1. Depreciation is not a process of valuation. Businesses do not record depreci- ation based on chan ges in the asset ’s market (sales) value. Depreciation is recapturing the cost invested in the asset. 2. Depreciation does not mean that the business sets aside cash to replace an asset when it is used up. Depreciation has nothing to do with cash. Measuring Depreciation Depreciation of a plant asset is based on three main factors: 1. Capitalized cost 2. Estimated useful life 3. Estimated residual value Capitalized cost is a known cost and, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, includes all items spent for the asset to perform its intended function. The other two factors are estimates. Estimated useful life is the length of the service period expected from the asset. The estimated useful life is how long the company expects it can use the asset. Useful life may be expressed in years, units, output, or miles. For each asset, the goal is to define the estimated useful life with the measure (years, units, etc.) that best mimics the asset’s decline or use. For example, a building’s life is stated in years, a truck’s in the number of miles it can drive, and a copier’s in the number of copies it can make. Estimated residual value—also called salvage value—is the asset’ s expected cash value at the end of its useful life. A delivery truck ’s useful life may be 100,000 miles. When the truck has been driven that distance, the company will sell or scrap it. The expected cash receipt at the end of the truck’s life is the truck’ s estimated residual value. Estimated residual value is not depreciated because you expect to receive this amount at the end. Cost minus estimated resid- ual value is called depreciable cost. Depreciation Methods There are many depreciation methods for plant assets, but three are used most commonly: - Straight-line - Units-of-production - Declining-balance Depreciable cost = Cost - Estimated residual value Plant Assets and Intangibles 465 Stop Think... Think about your car. What best allocates its use? Is it the age of the car, or is it how many miles you drive per year? How many miles you drive would probably be the best measure. That is how companies should pick depreciation methods—they should figure out what is the best measure to allocate the asset’s cost with its use and then pick a depreciation method that mirrors that use. Other Issues in Accounting for Plant Assets There are a few additional issues to keep in mind when accounting for plant assets. Changing the Useful Life of a Depreciable Asset Estimating the useful life of a plant asset poses a challenge. As the asset is used, the business may change its estimated useful life. For example, Gre g’s Tunes may find that its truck lasts ei ght years instead of five. This is a chan ge in estimate. Accounting chang es like this are common because they are estimates and, as a result, are not based on perfect foresi ght. When a company makes an accountin g change, generally accepted accounting principles require the business to disclose the nature, reason, and effect of the accounting change. For a change in either estimated asset life or residual value, the asset’s remaining depreciable book value is spread over the asset’s remaining life. Suppose Greg’s Tunes used the truck purchased on January 1, 2011, for two full years. Under the straight- line method, accumulated depreciation would be $16,000. (Refer to Exhibit 9-6.) Straight-line depreciation for 2 years = ($41,000 - $1,000)/H11003/H11003 = $8,000 per year /H11003 2 years = $16,000 1 5 12 12 In years 2013-2018, the yearly depreciation entry based on the new useful life would be as follows: 4,000 4,000 Depreciation expense—truck (E+) Accumulated depreciation—truck (CA+) Dec 31 Remaining depreciable book value (cost less accumulated depreciation less residual value) is $ 24,000 ($ 41,000 - $ 16,000 - $ 1,000). Suppose Greg’ s Tunes believes the truck will remain useful for six more years (for a total of eight years). At the start of 2013, the company would re-compute depreciation as follows: ÷÷ Remaining Depreciable Book Value $24,000 ÷÷ = (New) Estimated Useful Life Remaining 6 years = (New) Annual Depreciation, 2013-2018 $4,000 Double-declining-balance depreciation = (Cost - Accumulated depreciation) /H11003 (41,000 - 0) 2 life # 12/H11003 2 5 6 12/H11003 /H11003= $8,200= Again, since we used the asset for six months of the year, we only record 6/12 of double-declining-balance depreciation expense, or $8,200, in 2011.","{'answer': '1. **Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning:**\n   - The initial answer correctly identifies option D as the right choice, which aligns with standard accounting practices regarding the treatment of depreciation upon asset disposal.\n   - The reasoning provided is clear and logically sound.

        B) long an asset can be used
        C) easily an asset can be exchanged for another asset

The provided evidence discusses how different assets, such as inventories, receivables, and short-term securities, vary in their liquidity based on how quickly they can be turned into cash.

Inventories are converted into cash only when the goods are produced, sold, and paid for. Receivables are more liquid; they become cash as customers pay their outstanding bills. Short-term securities can generally be sold if the firm needs cash on short notice and are therefore more liquid still. Whatever the motives for maintaining liquidity, they seem more powerful today than they used to be. You can see from Figure 29.2 that, particularly in the easy-money years before the financial crisis, firms in the United States increased their holdings of cash and marketable securities. Some firms choose to hold more liquidity than others. For example, many high-tech com- panies, such as Intel and Cisco, hold huge amounts of short-term securities. On the other hand, firms in old-line manufacturing industries—such as chemicals, paper, or steel—manage with a far smaller reserve of liquidity. Why is this? One reason is that companies with rapidly growing profits may generate cash faster than they can redeploy it in new positive-NPV investments. This produces a surplus of cash that can be invested in short-term securities. Of course, companies faced with a growing mountain of cash may eventually respond by adjusting their payout policies. In Chapter 16, we saw how Apple sought to reduce its cash mountain by paying a special dividend and repurchasing its stock. There are some advantages to holding a large reservoir of cash, particularly for smaller firms that face relatively high costs of raising funds on short notice. For example, biotech firms require large amounts of cash to develop new drugs. Therefore, these firms generally have substantial cash holdings to fund their R&D programs. If these precautionary reasons for holding liquid assets are important, we should find that small companies in relatively high-risk industries are more likely to hold large cash surpluses. A study by Tim Opler and others confirms that this is, in fact, the case.2 Financial managers of firms with a surplus of long-term financing and with cash in the bank don’t have to worry about finding the money to pay next month’s bills. The cash can help to protect the firm against a rainy day and give it the breathing space to make changes to operations. However, there are also drawbacks to surplus cash. Holdings of marketable 2T.

Liquidity had evaporated. Nor was this an unheard-of phenomenon. The market crash of 1987, as well as the failure of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, also saw large declines in liquidity across broad segments of the market. In fact, several studies have investigated variation in a number of measures of liquidity for large samples of stocks and found that when liquidity in one stock decreases, it tends to decrease in other stocks at the same time; thus liquidity across stocks shows significant cor- relation. 25 In other words, variation in liquidity has an important systematic component. Not surprisingly, investors demand compensation for exposure to liquidity risk. The extra expected return for bearing liquidity risk modifies the CAPM expected return-beta relationship. Following up on this insight, Amihud demonstrates that firms with greater liquidity uncertainty have higher average returns. 26 Later studies focus on exposure to marketwide liquidity risk, as measured by a “liquidity beta.” Analogously to a traditional market beta, the liquidity beta measures the sensitivity of a firm’s returns to changes in market liquidity (whereas the traditional beta measures return sensitivity to the market return). Firms that provide better returns when market liquidity falls offer some protection against liquidity risk, and thus should be priced higher and offer lower expected returns. In fact, we will see in Chapter 13 that firms with high liquidity betas have offered higher average returns, just as theory predicts. 27 Moreover, the liquidity premium that emerges from these studies appears to be of roughly the same order of magnitude as the market risk premium, suggest- ing that liquidity should be a first-order consideration when thinking about security pricing. 25 See, for example, Tarun Chordia, Richard Roll, and Avanidhar Subrahmanyam, “Commonality in Liquidity,” Journal of Financial Economics 56 (2000), pp. 3-28, or J. Hasbrouck and D. H.

In reality, we cannot even observe all the assets that do trade, let alone properly account for those that do not. The theoretical market portfolio, which is central to the CAPM, is impossible to pin down in practice. Since the theoretical CAPM market portfolio cannot be observed, tests of the CAPM must be directed at the mean-beta relationship as applied to all observed assets with respect to an observed, but perhaps inefficient, stock index portfolio. These tests face surprisingly difficult hurdles. The objective is to test the SML equation, E ( R i ) 5 b i R M .

There is also a large entry collecting various other current liabilities. Current assets are larger than current liabilities, so net working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) was positive. The percentages in Table 30.1 show that working capital is not small change. For example, accounts receivable and inventories each accounted for 7% or more of total book assets. The sum of all current assets was 24% of total book assets. But don’t be too quick to take these average percentages as normal. There is wide variation across companies and industries, as we will see in a moment. The composition of your firm’s working capital will depend on the nature of its business and its relationships with customers and suppliers. It may also depend on your firm’s cumulative free cash flow. A company that generates more cash than it invests will often build up large holdings of cash and short-term investments. We will note the “cash mountains” accumulated by Apple, Facebook, and a few other highly profitable companies.

Completing the Accounting Cycle 211 Current Assets Current assets will be converted to cash, sold, or used up during the next 12 months, or within the business’s operating cycle if the cycle is longer than a year. Current assets are items that will be used up in a year, like your notebook paper for this class or the change in your pocket. The operating cycle is the time span when 1. cash is used to acquire goods and services, 2. these goods and services are sold to customers, and 3. the business collects cash from customers. For most businesses, the operating cycle is a few months. Cash, Accounts receivable, Supplies, and Prepaid expenses are current assets. Merchandising entities such as Lowes and Coca-Cola have another current asset: inventory. Inventory shows the cost of the goods the company holds for sale to customers, like tools at Lowesor cans of soda for Coca-Cola. Long-Term Assets Long-term assets are all the assets that will not be converted to cash within the busi- ness’s operating cycle. Long-term assets can be used for more than a year, like your car or computer. One category of long-term assets is plant assets (also called fixed assets or property, plant, and equipment). Land, Buildings, Furniture, and Equipment are plant assets. Of these, Smart Touch has Furniture and a Building. Other categories of long-term assets include Long-Term Investments and Other Assets (a catchall category). We will discuss these categories in later chapters. Liabilities Owners need to know when they must pay each liability. The balance sheet lists lia- bilities in the order in which they must be paid. Balance sheets report two liability categories:current liabilities and long-term liabilities. Current Liabilities Current liabilities must be paid either with cash or with goods and services within one year, or within the entity’s operating cycle if the cycle is longer than a year. Your cell phone bill is a current liability because you have to pay it every month. Accounts payable, Notes payable due within one year, Salary payable, Interest payable, and Unearned revenue are all current liabilities. Long-Term Liabilities All liabilities that do not need to be paid within the entity’s operating cycle are clas- sified as long-term liabilities. When you buy a car, you often sign up for several years of car payments, making it a long-term liability. Many notes payable are long-term, such as a mortgage on a building. The Classified Balance Sheet So far we have presented the unclassified balance sheet of Smart Touch. We are now ready for the balance sheet that is actually used in practice—called a classified balance sheet. Exhibit 4-12 presents Smart Touch classified balance sheet using the data from Exhibit 4-7 on 205. Smart Touch classifies each asset and each liability as either current or long- term. Notice that the Total assets of $75,500 is the same as the Total assets on the unclassified balance sheet in Exhibit 4-7. The classification of assets and liabilities as current or long- term affects many key ratios that outsiders use to evaluate the financial health of a company. Many times, the classification of a particular account is very clear—for example, a building is normally a long-term asset. But what if the company must demolish the existing building within six months due to some structural default? It would not be ethical to still show the building as a long-term asset. Connect To: Ethics","{'answer': ""### Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning:\n1. **Correct Identification of Long-term Assets**: The answer correctly identifies Option B (Building, Equipment, Patent) as long-term operational assets. This demonstrates a solid understanding of the classification of assets in accounting.\n2. **Clear Definition**: The reasoning provides a clear definition of long-term operational assets, stating that they are used in business operations for more than one year. This is a fundamental aspect of asset classification and is well articulated.\n3. **Categorization of Assets**: The answer effectively distinguishes between tangible (Building, Equipment) and intangible assets (Patent), which adds depth to the explanation and shows an understanding of different asset types.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in Logic:\n1. **Lack of Comparison with Other Options**: While the answer correctly identifies Option B, it does not sufficiently analyze why the other options do not qualify as long-term operational assets. A more thorough comparison would strengthen the argument.\n2. **Overgeneralization of Other Options**: The reasoning states that the other options consist of current liabilities or current assets without specifying which items fall into these categories. For example, Accounts Payable and Unearned Revenue are indeed liabilities, but the answer could clarify that Cash and Inventory are current assets.\n3. **Missing Context on Patents**: While patents are classified as intangible assets, the answer could benefit from a brief explanation of how they function as long-term operational assets, as this may not be immediately clear to all readers.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Detailed Comparison**: Include a brief analysis of each of the other options to clarify why they do not meet the criteria for long-term operational assets. For example, explain that Accounts Payable and Notes Payable are liabilities, while Cash and Inventory are current assets.\n2. **Clarify Asset Classifications**: Provide a more detailed breakdown of the classifications of the items in the other options. This would enhance the reader's understanding of why they do not qualify as long-term operational assets.\n3. **Expand on Intangible Assets**: Add a sentence or two explaining the role of patents as long-term operational assets, perhaps mentioning their potential to generate revenue over time, which would reinforce their classification.\n4. **Use of Examples**: Consider providing real-world examples of how businesses utilize long-term operational assets, which could help contextualize the information and make it more relatable.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would not only be more comprehensive but also more persuasive in its reasoning.""}",B,"Long-term operational assets, also known as non-current assets, are resources that a company uses in its operations for more than one year.

        Bob Co. purchased land and buildings for {eq}\$1,500,000 {/eq} in a basket purchase. The fair value of the land and buildings respectively are determined to be {eq}\$1,200,000 {/eq} and {eq}\$600,000 {/eq}. The assets acquired will be recorded on Bob's balance sheet as:
        A) Land {eq}\$1,200,000 {/eq}; Buildings {eq}\$600,000 {/eq}.
        B) Land {eq}\$1,200,000 {/eq}; Buildings {eq}\$300,000 {/eq}.

        D) Land {eq}\$900,000 {/eq}; Buildings {eq}\$600,000 {/eq}.
        ",B-3,B,"To allocate the total purchase price of $1,500,000 between the land and buildings based on their fair values, we first calculate the total fair value of the assets, which is $1,200,000 (land) + $600,000 (buildings) = $1,800,000. Next, we find the percentage of each asset's fair value relative to the total fair value: Land = $1,200,000 / $1,800,000 = 66.67% and Buildings = $600,000 / $1,800,000 = 33.33%. We then apply these percentages to the total purchase price of $1,500,000: Land = 66.67% of $1,500,000 = $1,000,000 and Buildings = 33.33% of $1,500,000 = $500,000. Therefore, the correct allocation is Land $1,000,000 and Buildings $500,000, which corresponds to option C.","Suppose Smart Touch paid a combined purchase price of $ 100,000 on August 1, 2013, for the land and building. An appraisal performed a month before the purchase indicates that the land’s market (sales) value is $30,000 and the building’s market (sales) value is $90,000. It is clear that Smart Touch got a good deal, paying less than fair market value, which is $120,000 for the combined assets. But how will Smart Touch allocate the $100,000 paid for both assets? First, figure the ratio of each asset ’s market value to the total for both assets combined. The total appraised value is $120,000. Total price of land and a building $100,000 + What is the cost of the building? What is the cost of the land? ? ? =+$30,000 Land Market Value $90,000 Building Market Value $120,000 Total Market Value=+ The land makes up 25% of the total market value, and the building 75%, as follows: Land Building Total $ 30,000 90,000 $120,000 $30,000/$120,000 $90,000/$120,000 =2 5 % 75% 100% /H11003$100,000 100,000 = $ 25,000 75,000 $100,000 = /H11003 = Market (Sales) ValueAsset Percentage of Total Value Cost of Each Asset Total Purchase Price/H11003 = Furniture and Fixtures Furniture and fixtures include desks, chairs, file cabinets, display racks, shelvin g, and so forth. The cost of furniture and fixtures includes the basic cost of each asset (less any discounts), plus all other costs to ready the asset for its intended use. For example, for a desk, this may include the costs to ship the desk to the business and the cost paid to a laborer to assemble the desk. A Lump-Sum (Basket) Purchase of Assets A company may pay a sing le price for several assets as a g roup—a “basket pur- chase.” For example, Smart Touch may pay a sin gle price for land and a building . For accounting , the company must identify the cost of each asset, as shown in the following diag ram. The total cost paid (100%) is divided amon g the assets according to their relative sales or market values. This is called the relative-sales- value method. /H17033Exercises E9-13 Determining the cost of assets [5-10 min] Ogden Furniture, Co., purchased land, paying$ 70,000 cash plus a $300,000 note payable.

Notice how total assets equals total liabilities plus stockholders’ equity. But a basic question remains: How will people actually use this information? The mass of data in Exhibit 1-6 will not tell a lender whether Smart Touch can pay off a loan. The data in the exhibit do not tell whether the business is profitable. To address these important questions, we need financial statements. As noted earlier, financial statements are business documents that report on a business in Prepare financial statements 9 The dividend decreases the business’s Cash and stockholders’ equity (Retained earnings). Dividends do not represent an expense because they are not related to the earning of revenue. Therefore, dividends do not affect the business’s net income or net loss. The double underlines below each column indicate a final total after the last transaction. The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Every business transaction affects various parts of the equation, but after each trans- action is recorded, the equation must ALWAYS balance (equal). Key Takeaway","{'answer': '1. **Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning:**\n   - The initial answer correctly identifies the need to allocate the total purchase price based on the fair values of the assets. This is a fundamental principle in accounting for basket purchases.\n   - The calculation of the total fair value of the assets is accurate, as is the determination of the percentages for land and buildings. This demonstrates a clear understanding of how to proportionally allocate costs based on fair value.\n   - The final conclusion correctly identifies the allocation of the purchase price based on the calculated percentages, leading to a logical answer choice (C).\n\n2. **Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:**\n   - The initial answer incorrectly selects option B as the answer, which is not consistent with the calculations provided. This indicates a critical error in the final selection despite the correct reasoning process leading up to the conclusion.\n   - The explanation does not explicitly state that the total fair value of the assets should equal the total purchase price, which is a key point in understanding the allocation process. This could lead to confusion about why the percentages are applied to the total purchase price.\n   - There is a lack of clarity in the transition from the percentage calculations to the final allocation. The answer could benefit from a more explicit connection between the calculations and the final answer choice.\n\n3. **Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**\n   - The answer should clearly state that the total fair value of the assets ($1,800,000) is greater than the purchase price ($1,500,000), which is a critical point in understanding how to allocate the costs correctly.\n   - The final answer should be corrected to reflect the accurate allocation based on the calculations, which is option C, not B. This correction is essential to ensure the integrity of the answer.\n   - To enhance clarity, the reasoning could include a step-by-step breakdown of how the percentages are applied to the total purchase price, explicitly stating that the calculated values for land and buildings are derived from the fair value percentages.\n   - Including a brief explanation of the implications of the basket purchase accounting method could provide additional context and strengthen the overall understanding of the topic.'}",A,"In a basket purchase, the total cost of the assets is allocated based on their fair values. The total fair value of the assets is $1,200,000 (land) + $600,000 (buildings) = $1,800,000. The proportion of the total cost allocated to each asset is calculated as follows: 

- For land: (Fair value of land / Total fair value) * Total cost = ($1,200,000 / $1,800,000) * $1,500,000 = $1,000,000. 
- For buildings: (Fair value of buildings / Total fair value) * Total cost = ($600,000 / $1,800,000) * $1,500,000 = $500,000. 

However, the question states that the fair values are $1,200,000 for land and $600,000 for buildings, which means the correct allocation based on the fair values provided is Land $1,200,000 and Buildings $600,000. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",C

        ABC Company sold a machine for $5,500 that originally cost $12,000. The balance of the Accumulated Depreciation account related to this equipment was $9,000. The entry to record the gain or loss on the disposal of this machine would include:
        A) A debit to loss in the amount of $3,500.
        B) A debit to loss in the amount of $6,500.
        C) A debit to gain in the amount of $2,500.
        D) A credit to gain in the amount of $2,500.
        ",B-3,D,"To determine the gain or loss on the disposal of the machine, we first calculate the net book value of the machine. The original cost is $12,000, and the accumulated depreciation is $9,000, so the net book value is $12,000 - $9,000 = $3,000. Since the machine was sold for $5,500, we compare this selling price to the net book value. The gain on the sale is calculated as Selling Price - Net Book Value = $5,500 - $3,000 = $2,500. Therefore, there is a gain of $2,500, which would be recorded as a credit to gain. Thus, the correct answer is D) A credit to gain in the amount of $2,500.","STEP 3: Then, record the value of any cash (or other accounts) paid or received. Since Greg’s Tunes received $0 for the scrapped truck, there is nothing to add to our disposal entry we are building from step 2. STEP 4: Finally, determine the difference between the total debits and total credits made in the journal entry. Total Debits are $18,000, and total Credits are $ 41,000. Credits > Debits, so we must record a Debit for the difference, or $23,000 ($41,000 - $18,000).

This is identical to what we jour- nalized in Situation A. STEP 2: Remove the old, disposed of asset from the books. To remove the asset, we must zero out both the asset and Accumulated depreciation accounts (note that this entry is incomplete at this point). STEP 3: Then, record the value of any cash (or other accounts) paid or received. Since Greg’s received $10,000 for the truck, we must add that Cash to our entry.

Credits > Debits, so we must record a Debit for the difference, or $13,000 ($ 41,000 - $28,000). This is a loss on sale. Situation C—Sell the T ruck for $20,000 Cash and $5,000 Equipment Selling the truck for cash and other equipment is still considered a non-like kind exchang e, as neither cash nor equipment has the same utility that a truck does.

This is a fundamental step in determining gain or loss on disposal.\n   \n2. **Accurate Gain Calculation**: The calculation of the gain from the sale is correctly performed. The answer clearly shows the formula used (Selling Price - Net Book Value) and arrives at the correct gain of $2,500.\n\n3. **Logical Flow**: The reasoning follows a logical sequence, moving from the calculation of net book value to the comparison with the selling price, and finally to the conclusion about the gain.\n\n### Weaknesses or Gaps in the Logic:\n1. **Terminology Confusion**: The answer states ""A credit to gain in the amount of $2,500,"" which is correct in terms of accounting entries. However, it could be clearer in distinguishing between the terms ""gain"" and ""loss"" in the context of the options provided. The phrasing could lead to confusion for someone less familiar with accounting terminology.\n\n2. **Lack of Explanation for the Entry**: While the answer correctly identifies the gain, it does not explain why a credit is used for the gain. A brief explanation of the accounting principle that gains are recorded as credits would enhance understanding.\n\n3. **No Mention of Other Options**: The answer does not address the other options (A, B, and C) or explain why they are incorrect. This omission leaves a gap in the reasoning, as it does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of all possible answers.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Clarify Terminology**: The answer should explicitly state that a gain is recorded as a credit and a loss as a debit. This clarification would help reinforce the understanding of the accounting principles involved.\n\n2. **Explain the Accounting Entry**: Include a brief explanation of why gains are credited and losses are debited. This would provide additional context and strengthen the educational value of the answer.\n\n3. **Evaluate All Options**: The answer should briefly evaluate the other options (A, B, and C) to explain why they are incorrect. This would demonstrate a thorough understanding of the question and reinforce the reasoning behind the correct choice.\n\n4. **Formatting for Clarity**: Consider using bullet points or numbered steps to present the calculations and reasoning more clearly.

This directly aligns with the definition of current assets, making option D the correct answer.","Completing the Accounting Cycle 211 Current Assets Current assets will be converted to cash, sold, or used up during the next 12 months, or within the business’s operating cycle if the cycle is longer than a year. Current assets are items that will be used up in a year, like your notebook paper for this class or the change in your pocket. The operating cycle is the time span when 1. cash is used to acquire goods and services, 2. these goods and services are sold to customers, and 3. the business collects cash from customers. For most businesses, the operating cycle is a few months. Cash, Accounts receivable, Supplies, and Prepaid expenses are current assets. Merchandising entities such as Lowes and Coca-Cola have another current asset: inventory. Inventory shows the cost of the goods the company holds for sale to customers, like tools at Lowesor cans of soda for Coca-Cola. Long-Term Assets Long-term assets are all the assets that will not be converted to cash within the busi- ness’s operating cycle. Long-term assets can be used for more than a year, like your car or computer. One category of long-term assets is plant assets (also called fixed assets or property, plant, and equipment). Land, Buildings, Furniture, and Equipment are plant assets. Of these, Smart Touch has Furniture and a Building. Other categories of long-term assets include Long-Term Investments and Other Assets (a catchall category). We will discuss these categories in later chapters. Liabilities Owners need to know when they must pay each liability. The balance sheet lists lia- bilities in the order in which they must be paid. Balance sheets report two liability categories:current liabilities and long-term liabilities. Current Liabilities Current liabilities must be paid either with cash or with goods and services within one year, or within the entity’s operating cycle if the cycle is longer than a year. Your cell phone bill is a current liability because you have to pay it every month. Accounts payable, Notes payable due within one year, Salary payable, Interest payable, and Unearned revenue are all current liabilities. Long-Term Liabilities All liabilities that do not need to be paid within the entity’s operating cycle are clas- sified as long-term liabilities. When you buy a car, you often sign up for several years of car payments, making it a long-term liability. Many notes payable are long-term, such as a mortgage on a building. The Classified Balance Sheet So far we have presented the unclassified balance sheet of Smart Touch. We are now ready for the balance sheet that is actually used in practice—called a classified balance sheet. Exhibit 4-12 presents Smart Touch classified balance sheet using the data from Exhibit 4-7 on 205. Smart Touch classifies each asset and each liability as either current or long- term. Notice that the Total assets of $75,500 is the same as the Total assets on the unclassified balance sheet in Exhibit 4-7. The classification of assets and liabilities as current or long- term affects many key ratios that outsiders use to evaluate the financial health of a company. Many times, the classification of a particular account is very clear—for example, a building is normally a long-term asset. But what if the company must demolish the existing building within six months due to some structural default? It would not be ethical to still show the building as a long-term asset. Connect To: Ethics Plant Assets and Intangibles 453 special characteristics. For example, you hold them for use in the business— not to sell as inventory. Also, - plant assets are relatively expensive. - the full cost invested in plant assets can be a challenge to determine because of the difficulty of tracking installation, shipping, and other costs related to the asset. - plant assets usually last several years and, as a result, should be allocated over the years they are expected to be used. - plant assets may be sold or traded in. Accounting for the disposal of a plant asset is important because the disposal may create a gain or loss that must be reported on the income statement. As you can see, plant assets pose some accounting challenges. Generally, plant assets can be classified into three main categories: 1. Real or tangible assets. This includes assets whose physical characteristics define their utility or usefulness, such as buildings, desks, and equipment. 2. Natural resources. This includes assets that come from the ground and can ultimately be used up. For example, oil, diamonds, and coal are all natural resource assets. 3. Intangible assets. This includes assets whose value is not derived from their physicality. For example, software programs on a CD are intangible assets. The “physical” CD is not the value—the knowledge/programs on the CD really represent the asset. Exhibit 9-1 shows which expense applies to each category of plant asset. In this chapter, we will conclude our coverage of assets, except for investments. After completing this chapter, you should understand the various plant assets of a business and how to account for them. Along the way, we’ll look at how both Smart Touch Learning and Greg’s Tunes account for their plant assets.

For example, the accountant lists first those assets that are most likely to be turned into cash in the near future. They include cash itself, marketable securities and receivables (that is, bills to be paid by the firm’s customers), and inventories of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods. These assets are all known as current assets. The remaining assets on the balance sheet consist of long-term, usually illiquid, assets such as warehouses, stores, fixtures, and vehicles. The balance sheet does not show up-to-date market values of these long-term assets. Instead, the accountant records the amount that each asset originally cost and deducts a fixed annual amount for depreciation of buildings, plant, and equipment. The balance sheet does not include all the company’s assets. Some of the most valuable ones are intangible, such as reputation, skilled management, and a well-trained labor force. Accountants are generally reluctant to record these assets in the balance sheet unless they can be readily identified and reasonably valued.1 Now look at the right-hand portion of Home Depot’s balance sheet, which shows where the money to buy the assets came from. The accountant starts by looking at the liabilities, that is, the money owed by the company. First come those liabilities that need to be paid off in the near future. These current liabilities include debts that are due to be repaid within the next year and payables (that is, amounts owed by the company to its suppliers). 1Home Depot’s balance sheet does include an entry for “goodwill.” This reflects the difference between the price paid to acquire a company and that company’s book value.

        Company A gave land to an employee as payment for services rendered. The land originally cost $43,000 when the Company bought it, but it had a value of $52,000 on the date it was given to the employee. Make the journal entry (or entries) necessary to record this transaction. Select one:

        ",B-3,B,"When Company A gives land to an employee as payment for services rendered, it needs to recognize the fair value of the land at the time of the transaction, which is $52,000.

The difference between the fair value and the original cost ($52,000 - $43,000 = $9,000) represents a loss on the sale of the land. Therefore, the correct journal entry would be to debit Wage Expense for the fair value of the land ($52,000), debit Loss on Sale of Land for the difference ($9,000), and credit Land for its original cost ($43,000).

Notice how total assets equals total liabilities plus stockholders’ equity. But a basic question remains: How will people actually use this information? The mass of data in Exhibit 1-6 will not tell a lender whether Smart Touch can pay off a loan. The data in the exhibit do not tell whether the business is profitable. To address these important questions, we need financial statements. As noted earlier, financial statements are business documents that report on a business in Prepare financial statements 9 The dividend decreases the business’s Cash and stockholders’ equity (Retained earnings). Dividends do not represent an expense because they are not related to the earning of revenue. Therefore, dividends do not affect the business’s net income or net loss. The double underlines below each column indicate a final total after the last transaction. The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Every business transaction affects various parts of the equation, but after each trans- action is recorded, the equation must ALWAYS balance (equal). Key Takeaway Plant Assets and Intangibles 455 The entry to record the purchase of the land on August 1, 2013, follows: 62,000 2013 Aug 1 50,000 12,000 Land (A+) Note payable (L+) Cash (A-) 20,000 2013 Aug 15 20,000 Land improvements (A+) Cash (A-) Architectural fees Building permits Contractor charges Payments for material, labor, and overhead Capitalized interest cost, if self-constructed Constructing a Building • • • • • Purchase price Costs to renovate the building to ready the building for use, which may include any of the charges listed under “Constructing a Building” Purchasing an Existing Building • • We would say that Smart Touch capitalized the cost of the land at $62,000. Capitalized means that an asset account was debited (increased) because the com- pany acquired an asset. So, for our land example, Smart Touch debited the Land account for $62,000, the capitalized cost of the asset. Suppose Smart Touch then pays $20,000 for fences, paving, lighting, landscap- ing, and signs on August 15, 2013. The following entry records the cost of these land improvements: Land and land improvements are two entirely separate assets. Recall that land is not depreciated. However, the cost of land improvements is depreciated over that asset’s useful life. Buildings The cost of a building depends on whether the company is constructing the building itself or is buying an existing one. These costs include the following: Machinery and Equipment The cost of machinery and equipment includes its - purchase price (less any discounts), - transportation charges, - insurance while in transit, - sales tax and other taxes, - purchase commission, - installation costs, and - the cost of testing the asset before it is used. After the asset is up and running, the company no longer debits the cost of insur- ance, taxes, ordinary repairs, and maintenance to the Equipment account. From that point on, insurance, taxes, repairs, and maintenance costs are recorded as expenses. There are many different kinds of equipment. Smart Touch has CD/DVD burn- ing equipment. Delta has airplanes, and Office Depot has copiers. Most businesses have computer equipment.","{'answer': '### Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning:\n1. **Recognition of Fair Value**: The answer correctly identifies that the fair value of the land at the time of the transaction ($52,000) should be recognized in the journal entry. This aligns with accounting principles that require the use of fair value for transactions involving non-cash payments.\n   \n2. **Identification of Components**: The answer breaks down the components of the journal entry, specifying the debits and credits involved. This clarity helps in understanding how the transaction is recorded.\n\n3. **Logical Flow**: The reasoning follows a logical progression from the recognition of fair value to the calculation of the loss on the sale of land, which is a necessary step in understanding the financial implications of the transaction.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in the Logic:\n1. **Misinterpretation of Loss on Sale**: The assertion that there is a loss on the sale of land is incorrect. In this scenario, the company is not selling the land; it is giving it as compensation. Therefore, the concept of a ""loss"" does not apply in the same way it would in a sale transaction. The original cost of the land is irrelevant to the journal entry, but the loss on sale is incorrectly included.\n\n2. **Incorrect Journal Entry Structure**: The proposed journal entry does not accurately reflect the nature of the transaction. The entry should not include a ""Loss on Sale of Land"" account since the land is not being sold but rather given as compensation. This mischaracterization leads to an incorrect conclusion.\n\n3. **Lack of Clarity on Gain/Loss Concept**: The answer does not adequately explain why the original cost is not relevant in this context. A more thorough explanation of the accounting treatment for non-cash compensation would strengthen the reasoning.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Clarify the Nature of the Transaction**: The answer should explicitly state that the land is being given as compensation for services rendered, which eliminates the need to consider it a sale and thus removes the concept of a gain or loss.\n\n2. **Revise the Journal Entry**: The correct journal entry should simply reflect the fair value of the land as an expense without referencing a loss. A more accurate entry would be:\n   - Debit Wage Expense $52,000\n   - Credit Land $52,000\n   This reflects the fair value of the land given as compensation without introducing unnecessary complexity.\n\n3. **Provide a More Comprehensive Explanation**: The reasoning could benefit from a more detailed explanation of why the original cost is not relevant and how non-cash transactions are treated in accounting. This would enhance the educational value of the answer.\n\n4. **Consider Alternative Options**: The answer could briefly discuss why the other options (A, C, and D) are incorrect, which would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the accounting principles at play and reinforce the rationale for selecting option B (even though option B itself is flawed).\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would be more accurate, clear, and educational.'}",C,"When Company A gives land to an employee as payment for services, the company recognizes the fair market value of the land as an expense.

If a desktop now uses 90 parts, what is the new kitting cost assigned to one desktop? a. $4.50 c. $2.70 b. $1.00 d. $3.75 5. Compute It can use ABC information for what decisions? a. Cost cuttin g c. Product mix b. Pricing d. Items a, b, and c are all correct 6. Which of the followin g would be true for a computer manufacturing company? a. ABC helps the company make more informed decisions about products. b. Manufacturing computers use only a few activities, so a companywide overhead allo- cation rate would work well. c. Most of the company’s costs are for direct materials and direct labor. Indirect costs are a small proportion of total costs. d. All the above are true. a. b. c. d. Kitting $ 3.75 $ 0.30 $11.00 $ 4.05 Boxing $ 11.00 $137.50 $ 3.75 $148.50 1. Which statement is false? a. Information technolo gy makes it feasible for most companies to adopt ABC. b. An ABC system is more refined than one that uses a company-wide overhead rate. c. ABC focuses on indirect costs. d. ABC is used ONLY for manufacturing companies. Use the following information for questions 2-4. Two of Compute It’s production activities are kitting (assembling the raw materials needed for each computer in one kit) and boxing the completed products for shipment to customers. Assume that Compute It spends $12,000,000 a month on kitting and $22,000,000 a month on boxing. Compute It allocates the following: - Kitting costs based on the number of parts used in the computer - Boxing costs based on the cubic feet of space the computer requires Suppose Compute It estimates it will use 400,000,000 parts a month and ship products with a total volume of 20,000,000 cubic feet.

It mentions the purchase price, shipping costs, and installation/setup costs, which are indeed necessary for preparing the asset for use.\n   \n2. **Clear Formula Presentation**: The formula for calculating the capitalized cost is clearly stated, which helps in understanding the reasoning behind the calculation. This clarity is beneficial for readers who may not be familiar with the concept.\n\n3. **Accurate Calculation**: The arithmetic performed in the calculation is correct. The sum of the purchase price, shipping costs, and installation/setup costs accurately leads to the total capitalized cost of $46,250.\n\n### Weaknesses and Gaps in Logic:\n1. **Misinterpretation of the Question**: While the answer correctly calculates the capitalized cost, it does not explicitly state that the salvage value is not included in this calculation. Although it mentions that the salvage value is not included, it could benefit from a more detailed explanation of why this is the case, particularly for readers who may not be familiar with accounting principles.\n\n2. **Lack of Contextual Explanation**: The reasoning could be improved by providing a brief explanation of what capitalized cost means and why it is important. This would enhance the reader's understanding of the concept and its relevance in accounting.\n\n3. **No Mention of Depreciation**: The answer does not address how the capitalized cost will affect future financial statements, such as through depreciation. Including a brief note on how the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the useful life of the asset would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of the capitalized cost.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Clarify the Exclusion of Salvage Value**: Expand on the reasoning behind the exclusion of the salvage value in the capitalized cost calculation. A sentence explaining that salvage value is considered when calculating depreciation, not when determining the initial capitalized cost, would be beneficial.\n\n2. **Provide Context for Capitalized Cost**: Include a brief definition of capitalized cost and its significance in accounting. This would help readers understand why the calculation is performed and its implications for financial reporting.\n\n3. **Discuss Depreciation**: Add a note about how the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the asset's useful life. This could include mentioning the method of depreciation (e.g., straight-line) and how it impacts the company's financial statements.\n\n4. **Formatting and Clarity**: Consider using bullet points or a numbered list to present the components of the capitalized cost more clearly. This would enhance readability and make it easier for the reader to follow the logic of the calculation.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the answer would not only be correct but also more informative and educational for the reader.""}",D,"The capitalized cost of the equipment includes all costs necessary to acquire the asset and prepare it for use.

        If an asset is being sold or exchanged, the gain or loss is always computed by comparing the:
        A) market value and cost.
        B) book value and salvage value.

If the asset was traded in a non-like kind manner or the fair value of either the asset received or given up is known, then the net difference will represent gain or loss on the disposal (or sale) of the disposed asset. Record the gain or loss to the income statement as follows: - If the total debits > total credits—a credit entry will be made to make the journal entry balance. The credit represents a Gain on sale (or disposal) of an asset. - If the total debits < total credits—a debit entry will be made to make the journal entry balance. The debit represents a Loss on sale (or disposal) of an asset. - If total debits = total credits—there is no Gain or Loss on sale (or dis- posal) of the asset. To apply this, let ’s consider the truck Gre g’s Tunes purchased on January 1, 2011. Assume the business recorded depreciation using the straig ht-line method throug h December 31, 2012. Accordin g to Exhibit 9-6 presented earlier in the chapter, Greg’s Tunes’ historical cost of the truck was $41,000, $1,000 was the estimated residual value, and $ 16,000 has been recorded in total accumulated depreciation throu gh 12/31/2012. Before we consider any transactions, the T-accounts would appear as follows: To illustrate accounting for disposal of an asset, let ’s consider the five options that Greg’s Tunes has to dispose of the truck. All options are assumed to take place on March 31, 2013. Separate exhibits illustrate each of the five options. 1. Situation A - The truck is in an accident and is totaled. The truck is completely worthless and must be scrapped for $0. There are no insurance proceeds from the accident. 2. Situation B - Greg’s Tunes sells the truck to Bob’s Burger House for $10,000 cash. 3. Situation C - Greg’ s Tunes sells the truck to Harry’ s Hot Dogs. Harry’ s gives Greg’s $20,000 cash and a piece of equipment worth $5,000 for the truck. 4. Situation D - Greg’s Tunes trades the old truck in for a new Toyotatruck. The fair market value of the Toyota truck is $32,000. 5. Situation E - Greg’s Tunes trades the old truck and $3,000 in cash for a Toyota truck. The fair value of neither the old or the new truck is known. Situation A—Scrap the Truck If assets are junked before they are fully depreciated, there is a loss equal to the asset’s book value. Let ’s apply the four steps for disposal outlined previously to demonstrate this: STEP 1: Bring the depreciation up to date. Depreciation has not been taken on the truck since December 31, 2012. It is now March 31, 2013, so three months have passed and we need to record three months of depreciation. The problem stated earlier that Greg’s is using the straig ht-line method, so we calculate depreciation for the three months and journalize. STEP 2: Remove the old, disposed of asset from the books. To remove the asset, we must zero out both the asset and Accumulated depreciation accounts. (Note that the entry is incomplete at this point because we must record what we have received, if anything, in the next step.) Chapter 4 The Value of Common Stocks 81 bre13901_ch04_077-107 81 08/28/18 03:53 PM Book values can nevertheless be a useful benchmark. Suppose, for example, that the aggregate value of all of Holstein Oil’s shares is $900 million. Its book value of equity is $450 million. A financial analyst might say, “Holstein sells for two times book value. It has doubled shareholders’ cumulative past investment in the company.” She might also say, “ Holstein’s market value added is $900 - 450 = $450 million. (There is more on market value added in Chapter 28.) Book values may also be useful clues about liquidation value. Liquidation value is what investors get when a failed company is shut down and its assets are sold off. Book values of “hard” assets like land, buildings, vehicles, and machinery can indicate possible liquidation values. Intangible “soft” assets can be important even in liquidation, however. Eastman Kodak provides a good example. Kodak, which was one of the Nifty Fifty growth stocks of the 1960s, suffered a long decline and finally filed for bankruptcy in January 2012. What was one of its most valuable assets in bankruptcy? Its portfolio of 79,000 patents, which was sub sequently sold for $525 million. Valuation by Comparables When financial analysts need to value a business, they often start by identifying a sample of similar firms as potential comparables. They then examine how much investors in the com - parable companies are prepared to pay per dollar of earnings or book assets. They see what the business would be worth if it traded at the comparables’ price-earnings or price-to-book- value ratios. This valuation approach is called valuation by comparables. Table 4.2 tries out this valuation method for three companies and industries. Let’s start with Union Pacific (UNP). In November 2017, UNP’s stock was trading around $117.

CHAPTER 18 Equity Valuation Models 593 its assets. Shareholders’ equity is this net worth. However, the values of both assets and liabilities recognized in financial statements are based on historical—not current—values. For example, the book value of an asset equals the original cost of acquisition less some adjustment for depreciation, even if the market price of that asset has changed over time. Moreover, depreciation allowances are used to allocate the original cost of the asset over several years, but do not reflect loss of actual value. Whereas book values are based on original cost, market values measure current values of assets and liabilities. The market value of the shareholders’ equity investment equals the difference between the current values of all assets and liabilities. We’ve emphasized that current values generally will not match historical ones. Equally or even more important, many assets, such as the value of a good brand name or specialized expertise developed over many years, may not even be included on the financial statements. Market prices therefore reflect the value of the firm as a going concern. It would be unusual if the market price of a stock were exactly equal to its book value. Can book value represent a “floor” for the stock’s price, below which level the market price can never fall? Although Microsoft’s book value per share in 2012 was less than its market price, other evidence disproves this notion. While it is not common, there are always some firms selling at a market price below book value. In 2012, for example, such troubled firms included Sprint/Nextel, Bank of America, Mitsubishi, and AOL. A better measure of a floor for the stock price is the firm’s liquidation value per share. This represents the amount of money that could be realized by breaking up the firm, selling its assets, repaying its debt, and distributing the remainder to the shareholders. If the mar- ket price of equity drops below liquidation value, the firm becomes attractive as a takeover target. A corporate raider would find it profitable to buy enough shares to gain control and then actually to liquidate. Another measure of firm value is the replacement cost of assets less liabilities. Some analysts believe the market value of the firm cannot remain for long too far above its replacement cost because if it did, competitors would enter the market. The resulting com- petitive pressure would drive down the market value of all firms until they fell to replace- ment cost. This idea is popular among economists, and the ratio of market price to replacement cost is known as Tobin’s q, after the Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin. In the long run, according to this view, the ratio of market price to replacement cost will tend toward 1, but the evidence is that this ratio can differ significantly from 1 for very long periods. Although focusing on the balance sheet can give some useful information about a firm’s liquidation value or its replacement cost, the analyst must usually turn to expected future cash flows for a better estimate of the firm’s value as a going concern. We therefore turn to the quantitative models that analysts use to value common stock based on forecasts of future earnings and dividends. 18.2 Intrinsic Value versus Market Price The most popular model for assessing the value of a firm as a going concern starts from the observation that an investor in stock expects a return consisting of cash dividends and capital gains or losses. We begin by assuming a 1-year holding period and supposing that ABC stock has an expected dividend per share, E ( D 1 ), of $4; the current price of a share, P 0 , is $48; and the expected price at the end of a year, E ( P 1 ), is $52. For now, don’t worry about how you derive your forecast of next year’s price. At this point we ask only whether the stock seems attractively priced today given your forecast of next year’s price. bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd 593bod61671_ch18_591-634.indd 593 7/17/13 4:08 PM7/17/13 4:08 PM","{'answer': '### Strengths in the Answer and Reasoning:\n1. **Clarity of Explanation**: The answer clearly states that the gain or loss is determined by comparing the market value with the book value.
