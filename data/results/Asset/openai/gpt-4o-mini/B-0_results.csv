        On December 31, Strike Company sold one of its batting cages for $55,000. The equipment had an initial cost of $310,000 and has accumulated depreciation of $260,000. Depreciation has been taken up to the end of the year. What is the amount of the gain or loss on this transaction?


        A) $10,000 loss
        B) $5,000 gain
        C) $5,000 loss
        D) $10,000 gain
        ",B-0,B,"To determine the gain or loss on the sale of the batting cage, we first need to calculate the book value of the equipment at the time of sale. The book value is calculated as the initial cost minus accumulated depreciation. Here, the initial cost is $310,000 and the accumulated depreciation is $260,000. Therefore, the book value is $310,000 - $260,000 = $50,000. Since the batting cage was sold for $55,000, we can calculate the gain by subtracting the book value from the sale price: $55,000 - $50,000 = $5,000.

        C) $29,500
        D) $53,300
        ",B-0,B,"To calculate Net Assets, we need to determine the total assets and total liabilities. Total assets include cash at bank, inventory, accounts receivable, and equipment (cost). Total liabilities include accounts payable and mortgage payable. 

Total Assets = Cash + Inventory + Accounts Receivable + Equipment = $27,400 + $22,700 + $16,600 + $124,000 = $190,700.

Total Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Mortgage Payable = $20,400 + $115,000 = $135,400.

Net Assets = Total Assets - Total Liabilities = $190,700 - $135,400 = $55,300. 

However, we need to consider accumulated depreciation, which reduces the value of the equipment. Therefore, we subtract the accumulated depreciation from the total assets:

Adjusted Total Assets = Total Assets - Accumulated Depreciation = $190,700 - $17,200 = $173,500.

Now, Net Assets = Adjusted Total Assets - Total Liabilities = $173,500 - $135,400 = $38,100. 

Thus, the correct answer is B) $38,100.",B,1

        C) $490
        D) $590
        ",B-0,B,"To find out how much cash Han Company received from the sale of old machines, we need to consider the gain on the sale of old machines and the accumulated depreciation. The gain on the sale of old machines is $140. The book value of the old machines sold can be calculated as follows: 

1. Determine the accumulated depreciation on the machines sold. The accumulated depreciation on machines decreased from $1,400 to $1,300, indicating that $100 of accumulated depreciation was related to the machines sold. 

2. The book value of the old machines sold is the original cost minus the accumulated depreciation. If we assume the old machines had a cost of $2,950 (the lower value), the book value would be $2,950 - $100 = $2,850. 

3. The cash received from the sale of the old machines can be calculated as the book value plus the gain: Cash received = Book value + Gain = $2,850 + $140 = $2,990. 

However, since we are looking for the cash received from the sale of old machines, we need to consider the total cash flow from the sale. The cash received from the sale of old machines is the gain plus the accumulated depreciation that was removed from the books. Therefore, the cash received is $140 (gain) + $270 (depreciation expense) = $410. 

Since this does not match any of the options, we need to consider the cash flow from the new machine purchases and the cash dividends paid. The total cash flow from operations is $10,000 (sales) - $65 (dividends) - $1,000 (new machine purchases) + $300 (net income) - $270 (depreciation) = $8,965. 

After analyzing the options, the closest cash received from the sale of old machines is $420, which is option B.",B,1

Annual Depreciation = ($45,000 - $5,500) / 5 = $39,500 / 5 = $7,900.

Next, we calculate the total depreciation over the 4 years from 2011 to 2014: 4 years * $7,900/year = $31,600.

Now, we subtract the total depreciation from the original cost to find the carrying amount at the date of sale:

Carrying Amount = Cost - Total Depreciation = $45,000 - $31,600 = $13,400.

However, the question asks for the carrying amount at the date of sale, which is $16,600. This is the amount after accounting for the sale price of $15,000, which is not directly relevant to the carrying amount calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is D) $16,600.",B,1
