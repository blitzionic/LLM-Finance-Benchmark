1,A stock's risk premium is equal to the:,risk-free rate plus the expected market risk premium,expected market risk premium times beta,expected market return times beta,treasury bill yield plus the expected market return,B,"The answer is
b. expected market risk premium times beta
A stock's risk premium represents an additional expected return that an investor desires to obtain from the stock, rather than investing in a risk-free security. According to the CAPM model, the stock's risk premium is addressed below:
{eq}\text{Risk premium} = (\text{Market return} - \text{Risk-free rate})\times beta {/eq}
a. Incorrect. The sum of the risk-free rate and market risk premium is the market return.
b. Correct.
c. Incorrect. By multiplying the market return with the stock's beta coefficient, it indicates the potential total risk on the stock, which does not refers to a risk premium.
d. Incorrect.

The first step is to determine the required return for Company A:

Required return = 4.25% + 0.70 � (11% - 4.25%)
