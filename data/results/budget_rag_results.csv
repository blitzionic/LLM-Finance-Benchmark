The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
A) Cost of goods sold, inventory, and purchases.
This budget is only prepared by merchandising companies because their inventory purchases relate directly to the inventory asset and cost of goods sold expense.
B) Direct materials.
This is the correct alternative because only manufacturing companies prepare direct materials budgets. Merchandising companies prepare a purchases budget that is similar.
C) Sales.
The sales budget is prepared by all companies to estimate their sales revenue, as a basis for the estimated cash collections schedule, as to base the cost of goods sold budget on
D) Operating expense.
All companies incur selling and administrative expenses and must therefore prepare an operating expense budget to plan and control these expenses.",Master Budget: The master budget is a planning document that has several parts.

We use the total actual cost and the total standard cost for the 1,200 pies produced in September to calculate the direct materials flexible budget variance:
Actual Quantity (AQ)
1,875
Standard Quantity for actual production (SQ) = 1,200 × 1.45
1,740
Actual Price per direct materials unit (AP)
$7
Standard Price per direct materials unit (SP)
$7.15
Flexible Budget Material Variance
= (AQ × AP) - (SQ × SP)
= (1,875 × $7 = $13,125) - (1,740 × $7.15 = $12,441)
= $684 U
The variance is unfavorable because the actual cost is higher than the standard cost.
b) Direct material price variance
We use the actual and standard cost per pound and the actual pounds used to calculate the price variance.
Actual Quantity (AQ)
1,875
Actual Price per direct materials unit (AP)
$7
Standard Price per direct materials unit (SP)
$7.15
Material price variance
= (AQ × AP) - (AQ × SP)
= $13,125 - (1,875 × $7.15 = $13,406)
= $281 F
The variance is favorable because the actual cost per pound is lower than the standard cost per pound.
c) Direct material efficiency variance
Actual Quantity (AQ)
1,875
Standard Quantity for actual production (SQ) = 1,200 × 1.45
1,740
Standard Price per direct materials unit (SP)
$7.15
Material quantity variance
= (AQ × SP) - (SQ × SP)
= $13,406 - $12,441
= $965 U
The variance is unfavorable because the actual number of pounds used is higher than the standard pounds allowed for the actual production.
Note that the sum of the price and efficiency variances is equal to the flexible budget variance.","Flexible Budget Variance: The flexible budget variance is based on the actual production and sales volumes and not the planned activity levels.

Taylor's actual net income must have been $167,000.
Recall that the flexible budget variance is the difference between the
actual results and the flexible budget amounts
. The static budget amounts are used to calculate the volume or static budget variance. This means that options a. and b. are wrong.
When a company has an unfavorable variance, it means that the actual performance was worse than the budgeted expectation. This means that if the budgeted net income was $175,000 and the company has an unfavorable flexible budget variance of $8,000, the actual net income was $8,000 lower than the budgeted expectation.
The
actual net income was therefore $167,000.","Flexible Budgeting: A flexible budget is an adaptation of the static or planning budget based on the actual activity level.

13,The flexible budget attempts to account for the recognition of variances to actual caused by changes in:,volume,hours worked,prices,none of the above,C,"The correct option is
c) prices.
The goal of the flexible budget is to make adjustments for price changes to account for differences between actual and planned results. The effect of price changes on expenses and income is factored in. The flexible budget is more reflective of a company's true performance because it adapts to price changes.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
a) volume: While shifts in volume can have an effect on bottom-line numbers, the flexible budget is designed to handle variations in revenue that result from price changes.
b) hours worked: Working hours are of less importance to the flexible budget than the impact of fluctuating prices.
d) none of the above: Since option c is correct, this option can not be correct.","Flexible Budget: When a budget has room to change according to needs, we call it a ""flexible budget.""

$4,200 unfavorable.
Given information,
Sales volume = 2,000 units
Standard price = $60 per unit.
Actual sales = 2,100 units.
Actual sales price = $58 per unit.
Determining the flexible budget variance for sales revenue:
The flexible budget variance for sales revenue results in $4,200 with an unfavorable balance as the standard price of $60 exceeds the actual price of $58. The actual units sold of 2,100 is multiplied by the difference between the standard price of $60 and the actual price of $58. The formula and calculation to arrive at the $4,200 unfavorable variance are shown as follows:
{eq}\begin{aligned} \text { Fexible budget variance for sales revenue } & =\text { Actual units sold } \times(\text { Standard price }- \text { Actual price }) \\ & =2,100 \times(\$ 60-\$ 58) \\ & =2,100 \times 2 \\ & =\$ 4,200 \text { Unfavorable } \end{aligned} {/eq}

Flexible budgets are also known as variable budgets.
The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:
a. Flexible budgets are also known as static budgets.
The static budget is the planning budget prepared at the beginning of the year while the flexible budget is derived from the per-unit amounts in the static budget and the actual activity levels. They are therefore not the same thing.
b. They are budgets that are developed at the start of the year and never adjusted.
This is true of the static budget, not the flexible budget.
c. They are of no use in comparing or evaluating actual results.
They are extremely useful in evaluating actual results because they separate the volume variance from the revenue/spending variance. This means that managers are evaluated on the items within their control only.
d. Flexible budgets are also known as variable budgets.
This is the correct alternative. Flexible budgets are called variable budgets because the total budgeted revenues and variable costs are adjusted when the actual activity level is different from the planned activity level","Flexible Budgeting: Flexible budgeting is one of the budget approaches used in management accounting.

Budgeted cash payments:
Cash payments lead to an outflow of actual cash from the business. Thus, budgeted cash payments are included in the cash budget.
b.
Budgeted cash collections:
Cash collections lead to an inflow of actual cash to the business. Thus, budgeted cash collections are included in the cash budget.

Option D) $940,800
.
The budgeted sales revenue for the third quarter of 2013 for Farley, Inc. can be determined as follows:
Let's first determine the budgeted sales in Quarter 1:
Budgeted sales in Quarter 2 = Budgeted sales in Quarter 1 × (1 + Growth rate)
Budgeted sales in Quarter 2 = 5,000 units × (1 + 0.12)
Budgeted sales in Quarter 2 = 5,600 units
Now, we can determine the budgeted sales in Quarter 3:
Budgeted sales in Quarter 3 = Budgeted sales in Quarter 2 × (1 + Growth rate)
Budgeted sales in Quarter 3 = 5,600 units × (1 + 0.12)
Budgeted sales in Quarter 3 = 6,272 units
Finally, the budgeted sales revenue for the third quarter is:
Budgeted sales revenue in Quarter 3 = Budgeted sales units in Quarter 3 × Budgeted selling price per unit

A flexible budget is a budget that changes with the actual activity level. The total costs of a firm can be broadly bifurcated into fixed costs and variable costs where the fixed costs do not change with the activity level in a given period while the variable costs change proportionately with the activity level within a relevant range.
Hence, a flexible budget format is such that the overall costs are categorized into fixed costs and variable costs. This is possible only in the contribution margin format where the contribution margin is computed by deducting the total variable costs from the sales revenue and the net income is derived by deducting the total fixed costs from the contribution margin.",Budgeting: Budgeting activity is usually carried out for the forthcoming financial year to make estimates for various metrics.

721,A startup typically does not become profitable or breakeven for:,the first year.,two to three years.,four to six years.,six to eight years.,B,"The correct answer is (b.) two to three years.
Start-up companies invest more in initial periods to attract customers through their strong sales and marketing techniques. The profit earned in the first year or two is spent on expenses or supporting further business processes.

Reasons for incorrect options:
Option (a.) is incorrect because the first is crucial for firms as they need to access the market and work on the areas where reinvestment is needed. Although the first year doesn't need to prove to be profitable, the earnings can be less.
Option (c.) is incorrect because when the firm operates for four to six years, it earns profit as the company operates in the growth stage and works on further developmental processes. Thus, the firm can reach a profitable stage if the planning and execution go in the right direction.

774,Principal components of a master budget include:,production budget,sales budget,capital expenditures budget,All of these.,D,"Correct Answer:
d. All of these.
The principal components of a master budget are the production budget, sales budget, and capital expenditures budget.
a) Production Budget:
This section details the number of units to be produced. This is based on the projections for inventory and sales. Thus, the budgets for raw materials and labor needed are captured.
b) Sales budget:
This is a budget that projects how many units of a given unit will be sold, and the amount of revenue that will be generated.
c) Capital Expenditures Budget:
This is the budget for the fixed assets that will be needed in the production budget. Fixed assets aid in the production of goods and services, but they are not consumed during the process.","Master Budget A master budget is a financial document that details the amount of money an organization plans to generate during a given financial year, and how that money will be expended. In other words, it is an estimate of incomes and expenditures for a company for a given financial year.",D,
775,The production budgets are used to prepare which of the following budgets?,operating expenses.,sales in units.,"direct materials purchases, direct labor cost, and factory overhead cost.",sales in dollars.,C,"Answer: c. direct materials purchases, direct labor cost, and factory overhead cost.
The production budget is based on the sales budget. This reports for the number of units to be produced so as to comply with the estimated level of sales and the level of ending inventories to be retained. Thus, once production is known, this provides information on the level of direct materials to be purchased, the direct labor hours needed and the overhead cost to be incurred.","Sales Budget: The sales budget is a component of the master budget. This reports for the estimated level of units to be sold within the period covered, including the estimated sales revenue to be generated.",C,
776,The purpose of the sales budget report is to:,control selling expenses.,determine whether income objectives are being met.,determine whether sales goals are being met.,control sales commissions.,A,"Let us discuss each alternative:
a. control selling expenses.
No, the sales budget report reports on sales revenue and sales units, not selling expenses.
b. determine whether income objectives are being met.
No, the report includes only revenue, not expenses, so it cannot be used to compare actual and budgeted operating or net income.
c. determine whether sales goals are being met.
This is the correct alternative. The report compares the actual and budgeted sales units and sales revenue to find variances and label them.
d. control sales commissions.
No, sales commissions are not included in the sales budget or in the sales budget report.",Sales Budget Report: The sales budget is the foundation of the master budget as it is the first budget that is prepared and other budgets build upon it. The sales budget report is a variance report prepared throughout the budget period.,C,
777,Which of the following is generally included in the sales budget?,Schedule of cash receipts for the projected sales,Desired ending inventory,Budgeted cost of goods sold,Schedule of cash payments for inventory purchases,A,"Correct Answer:
Option a. Schedule of cash receipts for the projected sales
.
a. Schedule of cash receipts for the projected sales
The sales budget includes the cash receipts schedule for the projected sales. It is computed by multiplying the estimated sales units by the estimated selling price.
b. Desired to end inventory
It forms part of the production budget and not the sales budget.
c. Budgeted cost of goods sold
It does not form part of the sales budget.
d. Schedule of cash payments for inventory purchases
The purchase budget includes the schedule of cash payments for the inventory purchases.","Budget: A budget is used to forecast the revenues and expenses for the future period. A master budget includes all the budgets, and the operating budget includes all the income statement items.",A,
778,"Which of the following may be responsible for a fair share of the perennial ""project cost overruns""?",Rapidly rising inflation.,Delays in obtaining contracts and permits.,Lack of raw materials.,Forecasting bias by the sponsoring manager.,D,"The correct answer is option
D: Forecasting bias by the sponsoring manager.
The leading cause of project cost overruns is the underestimation of actual costs during budgeting. Forecasting bias is the over or under estimation of expected project costs. Underestimation of the costs of a project is caused by managers' intentional or unintentional forecasting bias. Managers can be biased in their forecasts due to a lack of necessary expertise and knowledge. Some managers intentionally misrepresent project costs to make a project seem viable.
Explanations for the incorrect choices:
a. Rapidly rising inflation. This is incorrect because inflation is responsible for project cost escalation, not cost overruns. Cost escalation is an anticipated increase in project costs due to factors like inflation.
b. Delays in obtaining contracts and permits. This is incorrect because such delays would hinder the start of a project but not increase its expenses.
c. Lack of raw materials. This is incorrect since a lack of raw material hinders the implementation of a project but does not increase its costs.",Project cost overruns: Cost overrun is the sum of unexpected costs that exceed budget estimates in implementing a project. Project cost overruns are disadvantageous to a firm because it spends money intended for other purposes to cover unexpected project costs.,D,
779,"Within the cash budget, if budgeted receipts are less than budgeted disbursements, the company should then plan to:",Borrow to cover the shortfall.,Increase the selling price of goods.,Reduce projected expenditures.,All of the above.,A,"Within the cash budget, if budgeted receipts are less than budgeted disbursements, the company should then plan to
A. borrow to cover the shortfall
.
Many companies preempt such a scenario by maintaining a minimum cash balance so that shortfalls can be covered. Additionally, in terms of financing, companies may require a company to maintain a minimum balance or current ratio.
Analysis of Alternatives
B. The company may want to consider this, but this depends on market conditions.
C. Reducing projected expenditures, particularly if those expenditures are towards periods of higher revenues, would be self-defeating and the company should consider financing the gap.","Cash Crisis: When a company runs out of cash and can't make payments to employees, suppliers, or creditors, the consequence is a potential default on obligations.
