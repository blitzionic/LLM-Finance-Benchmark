b. Organizes assets and liabilities into important subgroups.
A classified balance sheet classifies assets and liabilities into different categories, like current and noncurrent. This classification helps in generating useful insights about the composition of assets and liabilities.
The other options are incorrect.
a.
Measures a company's ability to pay its bills on time:
The items that can be used to measure a company's ability to pay its bills on time are presented on a classified balance sheet. However, it is not a measure of liquidity by itself.
c.

2,Property and equipment is reported at its:,fair value,historical cost,book value,depreciation cost,B,"The correct answer is
b. historical cost.
Property and equipment are typically reported on the balance sheet at their historical cost. This is in accordance with the cost principle of accounting which states that assets should be recorded at the cost at which they were acquired. Over time, these assets are depreciated, reducing their carrying value to account for wear and tear, obsolescence, or other loss of value. However, the original cost remains the basis for this calculation. For example, a piece of machinery has a historical cost of $100,000 and a current market value of $80,000. This must be recorded in the balance sheet at its historical cost. In this case, it is $100,000.
The other answer options are incorrect.
a. Fair value: It measures the estimated price at which an asset could be sold or a liability settled in an orderly transaction. It is not used when presenting the asset in the balance sheet.
c. Book value: It is the balance of the asset after considering any depreciation, amortization or impairment costs made against the asset. It is incorrect.
d. Depreciation cost: Depreciation is the method of allocating costs to the appropriate period. While it's related to property and equipment, it's not the method for reporting their value.
e. Market value: It refers to the price an asset would fetch in the marketplace.

5,The classified balance sheet will show which liability subsections.,current liabilities and other liabilities.,other liabilities and long-term liabilities.,current liabilities and long-term liabilities.,present liabilities and tomorrow's liabilities.,C,"The correct answer is
option c. current liabilities and long-term liabilities
A classified balance sheet refers to the format of the balance sheet that classifies the line items into categories. It separates the line items and presents them under the category relevant to the nature of the business, which helps the readers of the statement more clearly understand the financial position of the business. The common classifications under the liability subsections are current liabilities, long-term liabilities, and shareholders' equity.
Other options are incorrect.
Option a. current liabilities and other liabilities
: This is incorrect because other liabilities are not a classification of liabilities under a classified balance sheet.
Option b. other liabilities and long-term liabilities
: This is incorrect because the option omits the important classification of current liabilities.
Option d. present liabilities and tomorrow's liabilities
: This is incorrect because neither present liabilities nor tomorrow's liabilities are the classifications of liabilities in the classified balance sheet.",Liabilities: Liabilities are the company's owed capital which is to be repaid after or during the predetermined period. It can be broadly classified into two categories: current and noncurrent liabilities.,,,C
6,True or False: Accrued expenses are liabilities.,TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"True
It is true to say that accrued expenses are liabilities.
Expenses that a business has incurred but not yet paid for are known as accrued expenses. Even though the money hasn't been paid out yet, these expenses are counted and recorded in the books of accounts. Liabilities are amounts that the company is obligated to pay in the future and do so because of future expenses.
An electricity bill received in May by a business would be considered an accrued expense if the payment wasn't made until June. Since the business benefited from using the utility's power throughout the month, it is now responsible for compensating the utility for its services. Accrued expenses are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet until they are paid in full.
The term ""accrued expenses"" refers to the monetary commitments that the company has made as a result of transactions or activities that have occurred in the past. Since these obligations must be paid or settled in the future, they are classified as liabilities.","Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is the section of a company's financial report that details the company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. Stakeholders should pay close attention to the balance sheet since it is a key indicator of the company's financial health.",,,A
7,True or False: Deferred expenses are assets.,TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"True
Assets include deferred expenses, also referred to as prepaid expenses. Any expenditure that is paid in advance but has not yet been incurred is considered a deferred expenditure. Because they represent future financial benefits that the company will receive, these expenses initially appear as assets on the balance sheet. After some time has passed and the expense has been incurred, the corresponding asset is written down and recorded as a cost in income.
When a company pays its insurance premiums for an entire year in advance, for instance, the full amount of the premium is initially recorded as a prepaid insurance asset. Each month or quarter throughout the year, the prepaid insurance asset is reduced and expensed in proportion to the portion that has been used.","Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is the financial report that lists the short-term and long-term assets and liabilities, along with the shareholder's equity.

9,"True or False: Under a classified balance sheet, assets are split into two groups.",TRUE,FALSE,,,A,"The correct answer is true.
A classified balance sheet categorizes assets into current and non-current (or long-term) assets. Let us describe each as follows.
Current Assets: These are assets that the company expects to convert to cash, sell, or consume through normal operations within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. Examples include cash, accounts receivables, inventory, and prepaid expenses.
Non-Current Assets: Also known as long-term or fixed assets, these are not expected to be realized, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle like current assets. These include investments, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets like patents or trademarks, and long-term receivables.

10,Which financial statement would contain the following account balance: Equipment?,Balance Sheet,Income Statement,Statement of Owners' Equity,,A,"The correct answer is
a. Balance Sheet
.
Equipment is not just a tangible fixed asset but also an operating asset for the business, contributing to the creation of revenue. Equipment is an economic resource subject to depreciation, reported on the balance sheet. Equipment sales and purchases affect the balance sheet and cash flow statement.

b. Income Statement

11,Which of the following is a category of accounts on a classified balance sheet?,Cash,Accounts payable,Long-tern assets,,C,"The correct answer is option C. Long-term assets.
Long-term assets is a category of accounts on a classified balance sheet. These assets are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or one operating cycle (whichever is longer). Long-term assets include:
Items like property, plant, and equipment.
Intangible assets (e.g., patents, trademarks).
Long-term investments.

95,"Before the 1978 reforms, China had a(n):",agricultural bank only.,urban credit cooperatives.,monobank system.,housing savings banks.,C,"The correct option is
c. monobank system.
China had a monobank system until 1978 when reforms took place. This meant that all monetary policy and commercial banking decisions were made by the same institution.
Here are the reasons why other options are not true
a. agricultural bank only:
There was a strong emphasis on agriculture in China prior to the reforms, but that does not mean the country had a dedicated agricultural bank.
b. urban credit cooperatives:
Before the reforms in 1978, the Chinese financial system did not include urban credit cooperatives. The dominating organizational type was the single-bank model.
d. housing savings banks:
Housing savings banks did not exist in China before the reforms of 1978. The financial system was dominated by a single bank that performed all banking services.",Agricultural Bank: The objective of the agricultural bank is to promote agriculture and other rural activities.

96,Bonds payable are usually classified on the balance sheet as:,current liabilities.,long-term liabilities.,investments and funds.,other assets.,B,"The correct option is
b. long-term liabilities.
Bond payables are a long-term liability for the company, as the company has to pay interest to the bondholder for a longer period of time until the maturity date. The maturity dates of the bonds are generally longer than one year. So, the company has to pay the principal amount and the interest rate to the bondholders beyond the one-year period, and hence it is a long-term liability.
Reasons why other options are incorrect:
a. Current liabilities:
This opinion is not correct because current liabilities count as liabilities for less than 12 months.
c. Investments and funds:
This option is not correct because investments and funds come under assets. Bond payables are liabilities.
d. Other assets:
This option is not correct because bonds payable are not assets but liabilities.","Balance Sheet: The balance sheet has details of the current and noncurrent assets and liabilities.

98,On which of the following statements is accounting generally presented in the order of liquidity?,Balance sheet,Income statement,Statement of owners' equity,,A,"The correct answer is option a. Balance sheet.
The balance sheet presents a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. Assets and liabilities are generally presented in the order of liquidity, which reflects the ease with which they can be converted into cash.
In the balance sheet, assets are categorized into current assets and non-current assets. Current assets, like cash, accounts receivable, and inventory, are listed first because they are expected to be converted into cash within one year or the company's normal operating cycle, whichever is longer. Meanwhile, non-current assets, like property, plant, and equipment, are listed afterward as they have a longer-term value and are not expected to be readily converted into cash.
Similarly, liabilities are categorized into current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Current liabilities like accounts payable and short-term debt, are listed first because they are expected to be settled within one year or the company's normal operating cycle, whichever is longer. Non-current liabilities, such as long-term debt and bonds, are listed afterward as they have a longer repayment period.
By presenting assets and liabilities in the order of liquidity, the balance sheet provides a clear picture of a company's ability to meet its short-term and long-term financial obligations. This information helps investors, creditors, and other stakeholders assess the company's financial stability and make informed decisions.

Paid-In Capital: Share capital is the money shareholders have invested in the company by purchasing shares directly from the company. This paid-in capital includes common stocks, preferred stocks, and additional paid-in capital.

108,Which of the following is not normally considered a current asset in a hotel?,"china, glassware, linen, etc",cash,prepaid expense,marketable securities,A,"The correct option is
A. china, glassware, linen, etc.
Current assets are those that will most likely be used, sold, or converted to cash within one year. The china, glassware, and linen in a hotel are certainly expected to be used for more than one year, barring any unexpected damage to the items. Hence, they would be considered as long-term assets, making them non-current as opposed to current.
The reasons why the other options are incorrect are:
Choice B. Cash
: Cash is considered a current asset, as it will most definitely be used within one year.
Choice C. Prepaid Expense:
Prepaid expenses are paid in advance, and the services or merchandise paid for in advance are expected to be delivered in the near future. Thus, they are considered current assets.
Choice D. Marketable Securities:
Marketable securities can be sold quickly and are most often used to satisfy obligations in the near future. Because of this, they are considered current assets.","Current Assets: In finance and accounting, assets are objects of value that a company possesses, owns, and uses for financial gain.

268,"If a bond is issued at a discount, the coupon rate is:",less than the effective rate.,not used to determine the bond's sale price.,greater than the effective rate.,equal to the effective rate.,A,"The correct answer is option A. less than the effective rate.
When a bond is issued, it has a coupon rate and an effective (market) interest rate. The coupon rate is the annual interest payment the bond issuer will pay to the bondholders, expressed as a percentage of the bond's par value. On the other hand, the effective interest rate is the rate at which investors are willing to lend money in the market.
A bond is issued at a discount when its issue price (the money received from investors when the bond is initially sold) is lower than its par value (the principal amount the issuer must pay to investors at maturity). This situation typically arises when the coupon rate on the bond is less than the effective interest rate prevailing in the market.

Debit Bonds Payable and credit Cash for the par value of the bonds.
When a company issue bonds, it receives cash from bondholders and records a liability called ""Bonds Payable."" Over the life of the bonds, the company pays periodic interest to the bondholders. On the maturity date, the company is obligated to repay the bondholders the principal amount (also called the par value) of the bonds.
When the maturity date arrives, and the company has already paid the final interest payment, it will need to record the repayment of the principal amount. The company must remove the liability (Bonds Payable) and record the cash outflow to do this.
This is done through the following journal entry:
Debit Bonds Payable for the par value of the bonds (to remove the liability)
Credit Cash for the par value of the bonds (to record the cash outflow)
This journal entry (option d) reflects the company's action to repay the bondholders the principal amount on the maturity date after paying the interest.","Non-current Liabilities : Non-current liabilities, also known as long-term liabilities, are financial obligations that a company has to pay off over some time greater than one year.

Option a: Current assets show company-owned assets that can be converted into cash, but the order of assets is not on a monetary value basis. This option is inaccurate.

Assets are economic resources expected to provide future benefits to a business. Physical form is not the only way an asset can exist; other examples of assets that do not have a physical form include patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
In fact, intangible assets such as brand recognition, goodwill, and intellectual property carry value of a business and contribute to its overall worth, despite not existing in a physical form. Therefore, while many assets exist in physical form, it is not required for an item to be classified as an asset.
So,
the correct answer is false.","Balance Sheet: The balance sheet provides information about a company's liquidity, which is the ability to meet its short-term obligations.

Assets are typically tangible items acquired by a business to help generate income and produce goods or services. These items have a value that can be either monetary or accounting-based. They are financial and non-financial resources that can include physical objects such as buildings, inventory, office furniture, vehicles, computers, and machinery, as well as intangible items such as digital assets, copyrights, trademarks, and patents. Assets can also include financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and investments. Assets are essential for businesses because they help generate revenue and provide a means of running the business. Assets also give the company a measure of financial security, as they can be sold or liquidated to meet financial obligations. Additionally, assets can help a business increase its value by generating returns that can be reinvested into the business.
Therefore,
the correct answer is option D. resources belonging to a company have future benefits to the company.","Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is one of a business's three significant financial statements to provide an overview of its financial position.

Out of the options provided, inventory is the only item that should be included in the current assets section of the balance sheet.
Machinery, patents, and goodwill  are not typically classified as current assets. Machinery is a long-term asset usually classified as property, plant, and equipment on the balance sheet. Patents are intangible assets, and goodwill, which results from a firm buying another for more money than its net assets, is also an intangible asset.
Therefore,
the correct answer is option b. inventory.","Balance Sheet: The balance sheet is a critical financial document that shows a company's financial status.

A balance sheet is a financial statement that contains detailed information regarding the assets owned by a business, the liabilities to be settled, and the net capital or equity.
Assets comprise fixed assets (tangible and intangible) and current assets. Liabilities comprise long-term and short-term obligations. The equity comprises the share capital and retained earnings.
Revenues and expenses are shown in the income statement. Service revenue is the net income generated from the services provided by the business. It is, therefore, an item that would appear in the income statement of the business.
The explanation for incorrect options is as follows:
Option A: Unearned revenue: It is a liability account, so it will appear on the balance sheet. It refers to the amount that has been received in advance by a business for its products or services.
Option B: Supplies: It is a current asset, so it will appear on the balance sheet. It refers to the items that are regularly used by the business to support its operations. For example, cleaning tools, packaging materials, and office supplies.
Option C: Prepaid rent: This is a current asset for the business.

An asset intended for use on a continuing basis in the company's activities.
Non-current assets are long-term assets, such as property, equipment, or investments that are not expected to produce a return within the next 12 months. These assets are used to provide financial stability and ensure that a business can continue operating in the event of an unforeseen expense or emergency. A common example of a non-current asset is a building that is used for business purposes but will not generate a profit for at least one year. Other examples of non-current assets are factory equipment, office equipment, delivery trucks, intangible assets, and the like.
Non-current assets can be categorized into two types: tangible and intangible. Tangible assets are physical objects that can be touched, such as furniture, machinery, vehicles, and equipment. These assets are subject to the annual depreciation (except land). On the other hand, intangible assets are nonphysical assets that cannot be touched such as copyrights, patents, trademarks, and goodwill. These assets are subject to annual amortization.
Therefore,
the correct answer is option d. An asset intended for use on a continuing basis in the company's activities.","Balance Sheet: In accounting, a balance sheet is a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time.

c. current assets
.
Receivables for a firm are assets because they represent the amount yet to be collected from customers for the goods or services already sold. Any asset with a maturity of up to 1 year is classified as a current asset.
Fixed assets are usually non-current assets as they have a maturity of more than 1 year while the investments could be classified into current assets or non-current assets on the basis of maturity.","Classified Balance Sheet: A classified balance sheet consists of sections like current assets, non-current assets, current liabilities, non-current liabilities, and shareholders' equity.

An account receivable is an asset for a given firm as it represents the amount to be collected from customers for the goods or services already sold. An account receivable usually has a maturity of less than 1 and hence, it is listed under the current assets section on the balance sheet.
Long-term liabilities and fixed assets usually have a maturity of more than 1 year so they are classified as non-current liabilities and non-current assets respectively. The investments could be classified as current or non-current assets depending upon the maturity.","Classified Balance Sheet: A balance sheet is a financial statement that shows the financial standing of a firm on a particular date.

(D.) $75,000
