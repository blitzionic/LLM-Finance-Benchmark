Under the allowance method, the bad debt expense is recorded with an adjusting entry at the end of each reporting period. This entry reduces net income. When an individual customer account is written off, the journal entry debits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and credits Accounts Receivable. This entry does not affect net income. It also does not affect total current assets because the net accounts receivable does not change. Net accounts receivable is Accounts Receivable minus Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

The other options are incorrect:

a. reduce net income and total current assets is correct under the direct write-off method, but not the allowance method.

Let us look at why all the alternatives are correct:

a. The direct write-off method overstates assets on the balance sheet is correct because, under the direct write-off method, the carrying amount of Accounts Receivable is not reduced by the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
b. The direct write-off method does not match expenses against revenue very well is correct because the estimated bad debts are not recorded in the same period the sales are recognized. Instead, bad debt is only recorded when an individual account becomes uncollectible.

The other options are incorrect:

a. allowance account will increase is incorrect because the allowance account has a normal credit balance because it is a contra-asset account. This means that the debit entry will decrease its balance.
b. cash realizable value of total accounts receivable will increase is incorrect because the cash realizable value of total accounts receivable is the same as the net accounts receivable. We have seen that it would not change.

The table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons:

A. that the prior year's estimated uncollectible accounts receivable must have been overestimated        This would lead to an unadjusted credit balance in the Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts account because the beginning credit balance would have been significantly higher than the debit entries to record the write-offs.
B. that the prior year's estimated uncollectible accounts receivable must have been underestimated        This is a possible reason but not the only one. It can also be that the company had large bad debts in the current year, and the expense recorded at the end of the year will reflect this.
C. that the current year's write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable were less than the prior year's ending allowance for uncollectible accounts balance        This is the correct alternative because the current year's write-offs are debits in the Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts account and the beginning balance is a credit.
D. that the direct write-off rather than the allowance method was used to account for uncollectible receivables        When a company has an Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts account in its general ledger, it uses the allowance method.

The amount of the adjustment to record the provision for doubtful accounts can be computed using the net sales and estimated bad debts percentage. The percentage of credit sales method doesn't take into account, the unadjusted balance in the allowance account for estimating the bad debts.

To calculate Manipulator Corporation's charge-offs for the year, we can use the following formula:

29,"Jody Sport and Hobby's Allowance for Doubtful Accounts had an unadjusted credit balance of $600. The manager estimates that $700 of the Accounts Receivable is uncollectible.

The balance sheet approach considers the unadjusted balance in the Allowance account when estimating the bad debts expense. The inputs needed to estimate the bad debts expense are given below:

Estimated amount of receivables uncollectible = $700
Unadjusted credit balance in the Allowance account = $600
Upon a logical arrangement of these inputs, we have the following result:

Bad Debts Expense = Estimated amount of receivables uncollectible - Unadjusted credit balance in the Allowance account
Bad Debts Expense = $700 - $600
Bad Debts Expense = $100
The entry to record the estimated bad debts expense is made below:

Joe's Auto Repair uses credit sales to estimate bad debts. Credit sales can be found on the income statement alone. Therefore, we can conclude that Joe's Auto Repair uses the income statement approach to estimate the uncollectible amount. The approach excludes the current balance in the allowance account while calculating the uncollectible amounts.

The net realizable value of accounts receivable is the Accounts Receivable asset minus the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts contra-asset.

32,"On December 31, Gill Co. reported accounts receivable of $228,000 and an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $1,300 (debit) before any adjustments. An analysis of accounts receivable suggests that the allowance for uncollectible accounts should be 2% of accounts receivable. The amount of the adjustment for uncollectible accounts would be","$1,300","$4,540","$5,860","$3,260",C,"To calculate the adjustment for uncollectible accounts, we need to determine the desired balance for the allowance based on the accounts receivable analysis.

Given the information provided:

Accounts Receivable: $228,000
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts (before adjustments): $1,300 (debit)
Desired percentage for the allowance: 2% of accounts receivable
Now, let us calculate the adjustment for uncollectible accounts:

Desired balance in the allowance for uncollectible accounts = Accounts Receivable * Desired percentage
Desired balance in the allowance for uncollectible accounts = $228,000 * 2%
Desired balance in the allowance for uncollectible accounts = $228,000 * 0.02
Desired balance in the allowance for uncollectible accounts = $4,560
It means the required allowance for doubtful accounts at year-end equals $4,560. The debit balance of allowance for doubtful accounts at the beginning of the year must be added to the required allowance to get the total adjustments that must be recognized during the year.

Total Adjustments = Required Allowance + Debit Balance of Allowance
Total Adjustments = $4,560 + $1,300
Total Adjustments = $5,860
It must be recorded in the book of accounts as follows.

Date	Account Title	Debit	Credit
xx	Bad Debt Expense	$5,860	
Allowance for Bad Debts		$5,860

34,The adjustment for bad debts using the percentage of receivables ignored the credit balance in the Allowance account. This error would cause:,total assets to be overstated.,total liabilities to be understated.,none of these is correct.,net income to be understated.,D,"The correct option is d. net income to be understated.

Under the percentage of receivables method, the uncollectible amount included in accounts receivable is estimated and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts account is adjusted to that amount. For example, if the estimated uncollectible amount is calculated to be $25,000 and the unadjusted balance of the allowance account is $3,000 credit, the adjusting entry would increase the bad debt expense by $22,000 and credit the allowance account with $22,000.

If the credit balance is ignored, the adjusting would have been processed for $25,000 and this would cause:

Total assets to be understated because the allowance account is overstated and that would cause the net accounts receivable to be understated
Net income to be understated because the bad debt expense is overstated and expenses decrease the net income.
The error has no effect on total liabilities.","The percentage-of-receivables method is one approach used to account for the bad debt expense under the allowance method.

It is under the balance sheet approach that the current balance in the Allowance account before adjustment is considered. The estimated bad debts expense will be calculated as follows:

Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts, also known as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, is a contra-asset account offsetting the Accounts Receivable account. Its purpose is to reflect the estimated amount of accounts receivable the company does not expect to collect, thus providing a more accurate representation of the collectible receivables in the financial statements.
