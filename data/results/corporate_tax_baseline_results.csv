d.
Explanation:
The deferred taxes in the balance sheet shows how much the company would have to pay in the future if it is a liability, and the deferred tax asset shows how much extra tax it has settled, which will lead to a reduction in taxes in the future period. It helps evaluate how much of the company's revenue is earned and received. It helps in assessing the cash portion of the profits. As per US tax laws, net operating losses can be carried forward as a deferred tax asset. Therefore, all the options are correct.",Deferred Income Tax: The book and taxable income variation are due to permanent and temporary differences. The variation due to temporary differences is the deferred income tax. It can be a deferred tax asset or liability.,,,D
6,"Under IFRS, income tax payable is based (calculated) on:",income before taxes,income for book purposes,pretax financial income,taxable income,D,"The correct option is D. taxable income,
because that represents the amount calculated on the income tax return and that the income tax authorities will use to issue the income tax assessment for the current year. This income tax assessment represented the income tax payable.
Income before taxes, income for book purposes, and pretax financial income are all terms used for the same concept, which is the net income before income tax as per the income statement which is the starting point for the income tax calculation. The current income tax payable cannot be based on this amount because it might include revenues and expenses that are treated differently for tax and book purposes, and that are therefore permanent differences or the temporary differences on which the deferred tax asset or liability is based.","Income Tax on the Balance Sheet: There are several income tax-related items on a company's balance sheet. Income tax payable is the current liability account that represents the tax payable in cash to the revenue authorities on the balance sheet date, while deferred tax assets and liabilities represent future tax benefits or obligations.",,,D
7,Which of the following is a result of a permanent difference?,DTA (deferred tax asset).,DTL (deferred tax liability).,Effective tax rate equal to the statutory tax rate.,None of the above.,D,"The correct answer is
d. None of the above.
The following table explores each answer option and explains the right and wrong answers with reasons.
a. DTA (deferred tax asset).
Only temporary difference causes deferred tax assets and tax benefits.
b. DTL (deferred tax liability).
Only temporary difference causes deferred tax liabilities and tax expenses.
c. Effective tax rate equal to the statutory tax rate.
Permanent differences and rate changes cause differences between the effective and statutory tax rates.

A goodwill impairment expense is recorded on the income statement; the goodwill did not have a tax basis when it was created.
The following table explores each answer option and explains which answers are right and wrong and why.
a. Bad debts charged off in the current period exceed the bad debts accrued in the current period.
This is a temporary difference because eventually, all bad debts would be deducted in the books and on the tax return, but the accounting and tax rules about how the deduction must be calculated are different.
b. Tax depreciation for the period exceeds book depreciation.
This is another temporary difference. Ultimately the total cost of an asset is recognized as an expense in both the income statement and tax calculation, so the difference originates and reverses over time.
c. Vacation pay accrued for tax purposes in a prior period is deducted in the current period.
This is also a temporary difference between the book expense and tax expense over the lifespan of the company will be the same, it is just a matter of when it is deducted for accounting and tax purposes that are different.
d. A goodwill impairment expense is recorded on the income statement; the goodwill did not have a tax basis when it was created.
This is the correct alternative. The goodwill has a related book expense (amortization) but it will never have a tax deduction associated with it because it does not have a tax basis. This means that this difference is permanent, not temporary

The Bayou Partnership has earned $45,000 in the current year which is taxable. Out of the total income of the partnership, Alfredo has earned one third which amounts to {eq}\frac{1}{3} \times \$ 45,000 = \$ 15,000

In the case of partnerships, the partners are taxed on their individual share of the firm's income. Alfredo has realized an income of $15,000 that has to be reported as the partnership has realized income as well.
Ans. b.
As Janet has received $13,000 in monthly payments, it can be reported as realized income. The IRS treads upon the wherewithal-to-pay concept that argues that a taxpayer must be taxed if they have the means or resources to pay the tax.

Explanation:
SFAS No. 109 deals with income tax accounting. It considers the issues faced with deferred taxes under the comprehensive tax allocation method. Some exceptions are applied to this standard in recognizing some of the items that arise due to timing differences. Hence, SFAS 109 doesn't maintain a comprehensive allocation method.
Incorrect options: B, C, D
B: SFAS 109 indeed follows the matching concept as it matches the expenses and revenues arising from the deferred tax assets and liabilities. It tries to match the differences that increase tax expense.
C: As the main aim of SFAS 109 is to deal with deferred tax assets and liabilities, it considers the asset-liability approach. It makes necessary disclosures when there is noncomparability of results.
D: As the income tax allocation is made to continuing or extraordinary items or other operations, the company can keep track of actual expenses incurred due to timing differences. Hence, SFAS 109 retained allocating taxes to give exact figures of deferred income.","Tax allocation: When there are timing differences in paying tax, the company allocates its tax accordingly.

While depreciation computations can be similar between a firm's financial accounting books and its tax books, the truth is that different methods are used (i.e. MACRS for tax accounting and straight-line/double-declining/units-of-production for financial accounting).

1)	Product warranty liabilities create a temporary difference as the organization has to report accrued product warranty liability in their financial statements.
