Analysis
a. a premium
A bond's sale proceeds must exceed the par value if the bond sells at a premium.
b. par
The par value and the bond's sale proceeds equal $100,000. It means that the bonds are sold at par.
c. none of the available choices

2,"A bond has a par value of $100. It pays 10 percent interest. 1,000 are issued. How much capital is raised?","$110,000","$100,000","$10,000 per year","$90,000",B,"The correct answer is
B) $100,000
.
Bonds are debt instruments that are issued by organizations to raise capital. The par value of a bond is the amount of money that is raised as capital from that bond. The interest paid for a bond is the amount of money, over and above the par value, that the issuing organization pays back to the bondholder in return for the debt, after a certain interval of time. So, the interest paid for a bond does not constitute the capital raised through the bond but is rather the cost of the capital raised.
Hence, in this case, we do not require the information regarding the percent interest.
The known and required values are:
The par value of each bond {eq}= \$100 {/eq}
Number of bonds issued {eq}= 1,000 {/eq}
{eq}\begin{align*} \therefore \text{ Total capital raised }&= \text{ Par value per bond }\times \text{ Number of bonds issued} \\ &= \$100 \times 1,000 \\ &= \$100,000 \end{align*} {/eq}
Therefore,
the capital raised by issuing 1,000 bonds at the par value of $100 is $100,000

We are provided with the following information:

(c) be accumulated in a deferred charge account and amortized over the life of the bonds

(a) Be expensed when incurred

(b) Be reported as a deduction from the face amount of bonds payable

Decision-making in investment should always consider the primary goals of the investor. What is good for one investor can be bad for another. In this case, the investor is primarily concerned with whether or not a stock is worth its current price. One indicator that we can use to determine a stock's value is the price per earning ratio, or P/E ratio. A low P/E ratio means that the stock is currently undervalued, while a high P/E ratio means that the stock is currently overvalued.
Assuming that the three stocks given are in the same industry or sector (different sectors can have different typical P/E ratios), the investor should choose Stock C because it has the lowest P/E ratio.","Investing Styles: In general, there are several styles of investing, one of which is called value investing.

d. Bonds
Let's first understand the definition of a current liability. Any liability that is due within one year is a current liability and the one that is due post one year is a long-term liability.

d. Whether a bond is trading at a premium to par, a discount to par, or at par depends on both its price and the par value.
The price of a bond refers to the amount for which the bond can be bought and sold in the market. The par value refers to the amount the bond issuer is obliged to pay investors when the bond matures. The relationship between these values determines if the bond will trade at premium, par, or discount. If the price is greater than par, the bond trades at a premium. If the price is equivalent to par, the bond trades at par. If the price is less than par, the bond trades at a discount.
The other options are incorrect.
b. All bonds traded at a discount to par make periodical semi-annual interest:
The frequency of interest payments depends on the terms of coupon payments stated in the bond indenture. The fact that a bond trades at par, premium, or discount is irrelevant to the frequency of interest payments.
c. Only governments and central banks can issue bonds:
In addition to governments and central banks, bonds can be issued by other entities like corporations and municipalities.","Bond: A bond is a debt instrument that enables borrowers to raise finance from willing lenders for a specific time period to meet their operational and expansion needs.

B) Incorrect. Mostly, a regular bond makes constant interest payments until its maturity date.
C) Incorrect. The coupon rate on a bond is a nominal interest rate. Hence, a bond is not a real security since its rate of return does not exclude the inflation risk premium.
D) Incorrect. Bonds are fixed-income securities, which should be considered less risky than other securities.

234,Bonds that give the holder the option of exchanging the bonds for capital stock of the corporation are called:,Convertible bonds.,Debenture bonds.,Callable bonds.,Coupon bonds.,A,"The correct option is
a. Convertible bonds.
If the bondholder wants to convert his bonds into the issuer's common stock, then he must have a convertible bond.

However, if the stock price does not go up, the bondholder still gets the annual interest rate on bonds in a predetermined manner.

(a) Dividing the premium at issuance by the number of interest payments.
The premium on bonds issued arises when the bonds are issued at a price higher than the face value of the bonds. The premium on bonds issued has a credit balance that is amortized over the tenure of the bonds.
The premium on bonds issued is debited by the amortization amount on each interest payment date. Under the straight-line amortization method, the amortization amount is computed by dividing the premium by the number of interest payments.

The 3-year bond rate can be calculated by taking the average of the 1-year interest rate of the 3 years and adding a premium to it.
The calculation of the average interest rate is as follows:
{eq}\begin{align*}{\rm\text{Average}}\,{\rm\text{interest}}\,{\rm\text{rate}}\, &= \,\frac{{{\rm\text{Sum}}\,{\rm\text{of}}\,{\rm\text{the}}\,{\rm\text{short}}\,{\rm\text{term}}\,{\rm\text{interest}}\,{\rm\text{rate}}\,{\rm\text{for}}\,{\rm\text{each}}\,{\rm\text{year}}}}{{{\rm\text{Number}}\,{\rm\text{of}}\,{\rm\text{years}}}}\\ &= \,\frac{{4\% \, + \,2\% \, + \,3\% }}{{3\,{\rm\text{years}}}}\\ &= \,\frac{{9\% }}{{3\,{\rm\text{years}}}}\\ &= \,3\% \end{align*} {/eq}
Hence, the average interest rate is 3%
.
The calculation of the 3-year bond rate is as follows:
{eq}\begin{align*}3{\rm\text{ - year}}\,{\rm\text{bond}}\,{\rm\text{rate}}\, &= \,{\rm\text{Average}}\,{\rm\text{interest}}\,{\rm\text{rate}}\, + \,{\rm\text{Premium}}\\ &= \,3\% \, + \,1\% \\ &= \,4\% \end{align*} {/eq}
Hence, the 3-year bond rate is 4%

The cash received against the sale of bonds will be {eq}\dfrac{\$400,000}{100} \times \$93 = \$372,000 {/eq}
The difference between the par value of bonds and cash received against the sale will be debited to the discount on Bonds Payable.

As the company will use the straight-line method to amortize discounts on the bonds. The bond's tenure is 5 years and interest will be paid semi-annually. So, the discount on bonds will be amortized in 5 X 2 = 10 installments.
So, on the first interest payment, the amortization of the discount on bonds will be $28,000 / 10 = $2,800
