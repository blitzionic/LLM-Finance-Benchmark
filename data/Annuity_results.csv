Let {eq}R {/eq} be the regular payment, in dollars.

Let {eq}i {/eq} be the periodic interest rate, in decimal.

Let {eq}n {/eq} be the total number of payments.

Then the formula for the present value of the annuity is

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ P = R \left[ \dfrac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i} \right] {/eq}



For the given loan, we must solve for {eq}R {/eq} to find the monthly payment amount.

Then we substitute the given values for the other variables.

Since the car costs $9,837.91 and a 10% down payment is paid, the amount borrowed is

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ P = (9837.91)(0.90) = \$8854.12 {/eq}

The periodic interest rate for {eq}8.875\% {/eq} compounded monthly is

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ i = 0.08875/12 {/eq}

The total number of payments (12 times per year for 4 years) is

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ n = (12)(4) = 48 {/eq}

Substituting these values of the other variables yields

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ 8854.12 = R \left[ \dfrac{1 - (1 + 0.08875/12)^{-48}}{0.08875/12} \right] {/eq}

Thus we obtain

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ 8854.12 = R(40.28078859) {/eq}

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ R = \$219.81 {/eq}

So the monthly payment for this loan is $219.81.",B,1

Compute the pension obligation that Onix has incurred today if the discount rate is 4 %.

Pension Obligation:
Pension obligation refers to the amount that a business must give its workers after they retire. It is computed based on factors such as employee salary, years of service, and the company's pension plan regulations. It is sometimes referred to as pension liability. On the balance sheet of a firm, it is represented as a liability.","$38,765.43","$40,554.64","$42,321.12","$44,217.89",B,"Given data,

Years left to the retirement of the employee = 8 years
The amount of pension the employee will receive at the end of the three consecutive years following retirement = $20,000
Annual interest rate = 4%
Interest is compounded annually.
To compute the pension obligation that Onix Corporation has incurred today, we need to go through the following steps:

Step - 1: Calculate the present value of the three pension instalments at the time of retirement, i.e., at the end of Year 8


Since an equal amount of pension is received by the employee at the end of each year for the 3 consecutive years following retirement, i.e., at the end of Year 9, Year 10 and Year 11, respectively, this cash flow series represents an ordinary annuity. The present value of this cash flow series in Year 8 can be calculated using the following present value of an ordinary annuity formula:

{eq}PV = PMT \times \dfrac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r} {/eq}

Where,

PMT = payment per period = $20,000
r = discount rate = 4%
n = number of periods of payments = 3 years
PV = Present value of the three pension instalments in Year 8
By putting the corresponding values in the above formula, we get:

{eq}\begin{align*} PV &= $20,000 \times \dfrac{1-(1+0.04)^{-3}}{0.04}\\ &= $20,000 \times 2.775091033\\ &= $55,501.82\\ \end{align*} {/eq}



Step - 2: Calculate the present value of Onix Corporation's pension obligation

The present value of the pension obligation that Onix has incurred today can be calculated using the following formula:

{eq}PV = \dfrac{FV}{(1+r)^n} {/eq}

Where,

PV = Present value of the pension obligation today
FV = The accumulated value of the 3-year pension instalment in Year 8 = $55,501.82
r = discount rate = 0.04
n = Years left to retirement = 8
By putting the corresponding values in the above formula, we get:

{eq}\begin{align*} PV &= \dfrac{55,501.82}{(1+0.04)^8}\\ &=$40,554.64\\ \end{align*} {/eq}



Therefore, the total amount of pension obligation that Onix has incurred today is $40,554.64.",B,1

Purpose of an Annuity:
An annuity is a flexible financial instrument with multiple uses, but its main objective is to offer a reliable source of income in retirement. Because of its tax-deferred growth feature, earnings will compound more quickly over time. Retirement planning can be stable and protected from asset outliving due to this consistent income. Annuities can also reduce market volatility, diversify sources of income, and provide advantages for long-term care planning. By enabling beneficiaries to receive any remaining funds after the annuitant's death, they also help facilitate legacy planning. Annuities are useful instruments for long-term financial objectives such as retirement planning since they are generally intended to offer stability, financial security, and peace of mind.","$2,100.35","$2,450.50","$2,327.12","$2,600.75",C,"Given information,

Amount of payment made for the annuity at the end of each quarter = $75
Annual interest rate = 3%
The interest is compounded quarterly.
Duration of the purchased annuity = 7 years.
Since the annuity requires an equal amount of payment to be made at the end of each quarter consecutively over the next 7 years, this cash flow series represents an ordinary annuity.

The total accumulated value of the annuity at the end of 7 years can be calculated using the following future value of an ordinary annuity formula:

{eq}FV_{Ordinary\ Annuity} = P\times \dfrac{(1+i)^n-1}{i} {/eq}

Where,

FV = Future accumulated value of the annuity
P = payment per period
i = interest rate per period

Individual Retirement Account (IRA):
One form of investing account that people can utilize to accumulate tax-advantaged money for retirement is an Individual Retirement Account (IRA).

The IRA is largely intended for use by independent contractors who lack access to corporate retirement plans, such the 401(k), which are solely offered by employers. However, anyone who has access to a workplace retirement plan can also open an IRA and use it to make additional savings investments.

$55,000 in a fund paying 3% per year, with quarterly payments for 20 years

Annuity Account:
An annuity account is a type of financial instrument that investment firms and insurance companies generally offer. It entails a number of equal payments made on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. These payments, which offer a steady income stream, can be issued for a predetermined amount of time or the entirety of the account holder's life.

Annuity accounts can be used for a number of things, including retirement planning and securing a consistent income stream for a predetermined amount of time. They are frequently used to augment other income sources like Social Security or pensions in order to guarantee a consistent flow of funds during retirement.

Annuities come in several varieties, such as variable, fixed, and index annuities. Every kind has unique qualities, advantages, and risks.",$502.34,$504.25,$506.19,$508.72,B,"The amount of quarterly payment necessary to accumulate $55,000 in an annuity account after 20 years is $504.25.



Since the periodic deposits are to be made in the annuity account at regular intervals and the end of each period, this cash flow represents an ordinary annuity.
To find the amount of each periodic payment (PMT) necessary to accumulate $55,000 in the above-mentioned annuity account at the end of the 20th year, we can use the following future value of ordinary annuity formula:
{eq}FV_{Ordinary\ Annuity}=PMT\times \dfrac{(1+r)^n-1}{r} {/eq}

Where,

FV = Future accumulated value of the annuity account
PMT = payment/deposit per period
r = interest rate per period
n = number of periods of payments
In the above-given problem,

FV = $55,000

{eq}n = \text{number of periods of deposits} = 20\times 4 = 80 {/eq}

Annuity:
An annuity if a security that pays a sum of money over a scheduled period of time based on the size and terms of the investment.

Annuity Due Meaning:
A succession of equal payments made at the same interval at the start of each period is referred to as an annuity due. Periods can be any specified length of time, such as quarterly, semi-annually, yearly, or monthly. Rent, lease payments, and insurance premiums are a few instances of annuity due payments. These payments are designed to cover services rendered in the time frame that follows the payment.","RM26,400.52","RM27,551.31","RM28,789.43","RM29,012.75",B,"Given information,

Amount of money deposited in a savings account at the beginning of each year = RM2,000
Duration of savings = 8 years
Annual interest rate = 12%
The total amount of money that will have at the end of the 8th year in her savings bank account can be calculated using the future value of an annuity due formula.

Since an equal amount of money is saved and invested at the beginning of each year consecutively over the next 8 years, the cash flow series represents an annuity due.

The future value of an annuity due formula can be represented mathematically as follows:

{eq}FV = P\times \dfrac{(1+r)^n-1}{r}\times(1+r) {/eq}

Where,

FV = Future value of the annuity due
P = payment at the beginning of each period
r = interest rate per period
n = number of periods
In the above-given problem,

FV = Future accumulated value of Sephia's savings account at the end of the 8th year
P = RM2,000
r = 12%
n = 8 years

Annuities refer to periodic payments, such as interest on a bond or the rent on a flat. In ordinary annuities, payments/deposits are made at the end of each period. Annuities that are paid at the start of each period are referred to as annuity due.

The total accumulated value of a series of payments at some point in the future at a given interest rate is referred to as the future value of an annuity.

Present Value of a Growing Annuity:
The present value of a growing annuity formula helps estimate the current value of a sequence of cash flows that increase proportionately.

The PV of a growing annuity has a set number of periods, in contrast to a growing perpetuity that continues for an indefinite time.

For a predetermined number of periods, the annuity payments are made at the end of each period. A discount rate is then applied, and the formula reduces the value of each payment to its present value. A growing annuity is also referred to as an increasing or graduated annuity.",14.35%,15.52%,16.75%,17.10%,B,"The above-given problem can be solved through the following steps:

Step - 1: Computation of the present value of retirement amount of $4.5 million

The present value of the desired retirement amount of $4.5 million can be calculated using the following formula:

{eq}PV = \dfrac{FV}{(1+r)^n} {/eq}

Where,

PV = Present value
FV = Future value of the retirement amount = $4,500,000
r = annual interest rate = 9.4%
n = number of years = 35
By putting the corresponding values in the above formula, we get:

{eq}\begin{align*} PV &= \dfrac{4,500,000}{(1+0.094)^{35}}\\ &=$193,912.70\\ \end{align*} {/eq}



The present value of the retirement amount is $193,912.70.



Step - 2: Computation of the first year savings amount

To accumulate $4.5 million for retirement after 35 years, a fixed percentage of the salary is saved and invested at the end of each year.
Again, the annual salary will increase at a rate of 3% per year.
To calculate the amount of money that is invested at the end of the first year we can use the following present value of a growing ordinary annuity formula:

{eq}PV = P \times \dfrac{1 - \left(\dfrac{(1+g)^n}{(1+r)^n }\right)}{r-g}\\ {/eq}

Where,

PV = Present value of the growing ordinary annuity
P = First year annuity payment
r = annual interest rate
n = number of periods of annuity
g = growth rate per annum
In the above-given problem,

PV = $193,912.70
r = 0.094
g = 0.03
n = 35
By putting the corresponding values in the above formula, we get:

{eq}$193,912.70 = P \times \dfrac{1 - \left(\dfrac{(1+0.03)^{35}}{(1+0.094)^{35}}\right)}{0.094-0.03}\\ Or,\ $193,912.70 = P \times \dfrac{1-0.121254145}{0.064}\\ Or,\ $193,912.70 = P \times 13.73040398\\ Or,\ P = \dfrac{193,912.70}{13.73040398}\\ Or,\ P = $14,122.86924 {/eq}



The portion of the salary that is saved at the end of the first year is $14,122.87.



Step - 3: Computation of the constant salary percentage that is saved every year

Amount of money saved at the end of the first year = $14,122.87.
Amount of salary received at the end of the first year = $91,000
{eq}\begin{align*} \text{Percentage of the salary saved} &=\dfrac{14,122.87}{91,000}\\ &= 0.155196373\\ &= 15.52\%\ (rounded\ off)\\ \end{align*} {/eq}

Calculating a Loan Refinance Amount
Given a loan that is being repaid with regular equal payments over a period of time, it is possible to determine the new present value of the loan if an extra payment is made after a certain point. We can also calculate the new regular payment amount if the original time period is shortened by a specified number of years.",$837.92,$848.41,$859.54,$872.18,B,"Because the loan is being repaid with regular equal payments, we use the present value annuity formula to answer this question. This formula is expressed as:

{eq}\rm P = R \left[ \dfrac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i} \right] {/eq}, where:

P is the present value of the loan
R is the regular payment amount
i is the periodic interest rate
n is the total number of payments


We are given that the loan was set up to be paid off over 19 years. To determine the new present value P (amount still owed) after 4 years, we note that there are 15 years remaining.

Then, we have the following values:

R = $1,000
i = 7.1% = 0.071
n = 15 years


Thus, the new present value of the loan after 4 years is:

{eq}\rm P = 1000 \left[ \dfrac{1 - (1 + 0.071)^{-15}}{0.071} \right] = \$9050.66 {/eq}



Next, when the extra payment of $2,000 is made, the present value is reduced to P = $7,050.66. Also, the number of remaining annual payments is reduced from 15 to 13. This produces the following values:

P = $7,050.66
i = 0.071
n = 13


Then, the new annual payment amount may be found by solving for R in the formula:

{eq}\rm 7050.66 = R \left[ \dfrac{1 - (1 + 0.071)^{-13}}{0.071} \right] {/eq}



This yields:

A bank, financial firm, online brokerage, or personal broker can all help an individual start an IRA. There are different types of IRAs like traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRAs, etc. Everyone who has earned income, including those who have a 401(k) account through their workplace, is eligible to open and make contributions to an IRA. The only limitation is the maximum amount of money that one can contribute to their account per year.","$308,125.45","$310,226.03","$312,345.78","$315,450.67",B,"The approximate balance of Amanda's retirement account on her 65th birthday must be $310,226.03.



Given information,

Yearly withdrawal amount = $25,000
Total duration of withdrawal = 30 years
Annual interest rate = 7%
Amanda will start withdrawing money a year after she turns 65.
Since Amanda intends to withdraw an equal amount of money from her retirement account at the end of each year over a period of 30 years after she turns 65, this cash flow series represents an ordinary annuity.

The amount of money that Amanda should have in her retirement account on her 65th birthday to fund this withdrawal plan can be estimated using the following present value of the ordinary annuity formula:

PMT = payment per period
r = annual interest rate
n = number of periods

An annuity's future value formula can be used to estimate the total accumulated value of a series of equal payments at a specific future date. On the other hand, the amount needed currently to generate a series of future payments is measured by the present value of an annuity formula.
In an ordinary annuity the payments are made at the end of each period. In contrast, in an annuity due the payments are made at the start of each period.
An annuity's future value can only be determined by knowing its expected rate of return, total number of periods, and annuity payment amount per period.
Given data,

Amount of money contributed at the end of every 3 months into an RSSP fund = $534.
Annual interest rate = 4.45%.
The interest is compounded quarterly.
Duration of investment = 14 years.
Since an equal amount of money is contributed to the RRSP fund at the end of every 3 months for the next 14 years, this cash flow represents an ordinary annuity. The future value of an ordinary annuity can be calculated using the following formula:

{eq}FV_{Ordinary Annuity} = A\times \dfrac{\left(1+\dfrac{r}{m}\right)^{mT}-1}{\dfrac{r}{m}} {/eq}

Where,

A = deposit per period = $534
r = annual interest rate = 4.45%
m = number of times the interest is compounded per period = 4 (quarterly)
T = duration of investment = 14 years

In the withdrawal phase, the annuity starts paying money to the investor.","$200,543.25","$202,145.00","$204,789.33","$206,123.45",B,"Given data,

Annuity payment per period = $3,500
Annuity amount is paid at the end of every month
Interest rate on annuity = 2.75% compounded semi-annually
The first withdrawal is to be made in 5 years and 1 month.


To find out the amount of money Kay paid to purchase the annuity, we need to determine the present value of the annuity.
Since the annuity pays an equal amount of money at the end of every month for 6 years, it's an ordinary annuity.
The present value of the given annuity can be determined through the following steps:

Step - 1: Computation of the interest rate compounded monthly

Since the compounding frequency of the given interest rate is semi-annual but the frequency of money withdrawal from the annuity is monthly, we need to first convert the compounding frequency into monthly using the following formula:

{eq}i =q\times \left[\left(1+\dfrac{r}{m}\right)^{m/q}-1\right]\\ {/eq}

Where,

i = new interest rate with compounding frequency as monthly
r = interest rate compounded semi-annually = 0.275
m = old compounding frequency i.e. semi-annually = 2
q = new compounding frequency i.e. monthly = 12
By putting the corresponding values in the above formula, we get:

{eq}\begin{align*} i &=12\times \left[\left(1+\dfrac{0.0275}{2}\right)^{2/12}-1\right]\\ &=12\times[1.002278647-1]\\ &=0.027343759\\ &=2.7343759\%\\ \end{align*} {/eq}



Thus, the equivalent interest rate compounded monthly is 2.73% (rounded off to two decimal places).



Step - 2: Computation of the present value of the deferred annuity

Since the withdrawal of money from the given annuity doesn't start immediately and is deferred by 5 years and 1 month, we need to determine the present value of the ordinary annuity by using the following formula:

{eq}PV_{Ordinary\ Annuity}=PMT\times \dfrac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{(1+r)^t\times r} {/eq}

Where,

{eq}PMT = \text{annuity payment per period} = $3,500\\ r = \text{monthly interest rate on the annuity} = \dfrac{0.0273}{12}=0.002275\\ n = \text{number of periods of payment} = 6\times 12=72\\ t = \text{number of periods of deferral} = \text{5 years and 1 month} = 61\ months {/eq}



By putting the corresponding values in the above formula, we get:

{eq}\begin{align*} PV &= $3,500\times \dfrac{1-(1+0.00275)^{-72}}{(1+0.00275)^{61}\times 0.00275}\\ &=$3,500\times \dfrac{0.150930266}{0.0026132573}\\ &=$3,500\times 57.755608\\ &=$202,144.63\\ \end{align*} {/eq}

Number of years, {eq}n =13 {/eq}
Compounding period is annual, {eq}m =1 {/eq}
Annual Interest rate, {eq}r = 6\% {/eq}
The payment that occurs at the end of the period is called an ordinary annuity. The present value of an annuity is the current value of a series of future payments. The value of the annuity is equal to the sum of the present values of all of the regular payments.

Recall the formula to find the present value of the annuity.

{eq}PV = PMT \left ( \dfrac{{1 - {{\left( {1 + r/m} \right)}^{ - n}}}}{{r/m}} \right ) {/eq}

Substitute the known values in the above equation:

$$\begin{aligned} PV &= PMT \left ( \dfrac{{1 - {{\left( {1 + r/m} \right)}^{ - n}}}}{{r/m}} \right )\\&= 450 \times \left ( \dfrac{{1 - {{\left( {1 + 0.06/1} \right)}^{ -13 }}}}{{{0.06/1}}} \right )\\&=450\left ( \dfrac{1-\left ( 1.06 \right )^{-13}}{0.06} \right )\\&\approx 450\left ( \dfrac{1-0.4688}{0.06} \right )\\&\approx 450\left ( 8.8526 \right )\\ &\approx 3983.71\end{aligned}\\ $$

The value of the annuity will be it present value.

To calculate the value of the annuity, we will calculate the cumulative present value factor first.

{eq}\text{Cumulative present value factor} = \dfrac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{\frac{i}{1 + i}} {/eq}

where,

i = interest rate

n = number of years

Here,

i = 6.25%

n = 6 years

Putting values, we get -

{eq}\begin{align} \text{Cumulative present value factor} &= \dfrac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{\frac{i}{1 + i}}\\ &= \dfrac{1 - (1 + 0.0625)^{-6}}{\frac{0.0625}{1 + 0.0625}}\\ &= \dfrac{1 - (1.0625)^{-6}}{\frac{0.0625}{1.0625}}\\ &= 5.18387\\ \end{align} {/eq}
