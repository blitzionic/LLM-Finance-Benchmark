Let {eq}R {/eq} be the regular payment, in dollars.

Let {eq}i {/eq} be the periodic interest rate, in decimal.

Let {eq}n {/eq} be the total number of payments.

Then the formula for the present value of the annuity is

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ P = R \left[ \dfrac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i} \right] {/eq}



For the given loan, we must solve for {eq}R {/eq} to find the monthly payment amount.

Then we substitute the given values for the other variables.

Since the car costs $9,837.91 and a 10% down payment is paid, the amount borrowed is

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ P = (9837.91)(0.90) = \$8854.12 {/eq}

The periodic interest rate for {eq}8.875\% {/eq} compounded monthly is

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ i = 0.08875/12 {/eq}

The total number of payments (12 times per year for 4 years) is

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ n = (12)(4) = 48 {/eq}

Substituting these values of the other variables yields

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ 8854.12 = R \left[ \dfrac{1 - (1 + 0.08875/12)^{-48}}{0.08875/12} \right] {/eq}

Thus we obtain

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ 8854.12 = R(40.28078859) {/eq}

and hence

{eq}\ \ \ \ \ R = \$219.81 {/eq}

So the monthly payment for this loan is $219.81.",N,

7,"Onix Corporation is required to pay the pension cost of one of its unionized employees. According to the union contract terms, the employee will retire in eight years and receive $ 20,000 at the end of the three consecutive years following retirement. Interest is compounded annually.

Compute the pension obligation that Onix has incurred today if the discount rate is 4 %.

Pension Obligation:
Pension obligation refers to the amount that a business must give its workers after they retire. It is computed based on factors such as employee salary, years of service, and the company's pension plan regulations. It is sometimes referred to as pension liability. On the balance sheet of a firm, it is represented as a liability.","$38,765.43","$40,554.64","$42,321.12","$44,217.89",B,"Given data,

Years left to the retirement of the employee = 8 years
The amount of pension the employee will receive at the end of the three consecutive years following retirement = $20,000
Annual interest rate = 4%
Interest is compounded annually.
To compute the pension obligation that Onix Corporation has incurred today, we need to go through the following steps:

Step - 1: Calculate the present value of the three pension instalments at the time of retirement, i.e., at the end of Year 8


Since an equal amount of pension is received by the employee at the end of each year for the 3 consecutive years following retirement, i.e., at the end of Year 9, Year 10 and Year 11, respectively, this cash flow series represents an ordinary annuity. The present value of this cash flow series in Year 8 can be calculated using the following present value of an ordinary annuity formula:

{eq}PV = PMT \times \dfrac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r} {/eq}

Where,

PMT = payment per period = $20,000
r = discount rate = 4%
n = number of periods of payments = 3 years
PV = Present value of the three pension instalments in Year 8
By putting the corresponding values in the above formula, we get:

{eq}\begin{align*} PV &= $20,000 \times \dfrac{1-(1+0.04)^{-3}}{0.04}\\ &= $20,000 \times 2.775091033\\ &= $55,501.82\\ \end{align*} {/eq}



Step - 2: Calculate the present value of Onix Corporation's pension obligation

The present value of the pension obligation that Onix has incurred today can be calculated using the following formula:

{eq}PV = \dfrac{FV}{(1+r)^n} {/eq}

Where,

PV = Present value of the pension obligation today
FV = The accumulated value of the 3-year pension instalment in Year 8 = $55,501.82
r = discount rate = 0.04
n = Years left to retirement = 8
By putting the corresponding values in the above formula, we get:

{eq}\begin{align*} PV &= \dfrac{55,501.82}{(1+0.04)^8}\\ &=$40,554.64\\ \end{align*} {/eq}

We need to convert the annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate since contributions are monthly. The formula to do this is: monthly rate = (1 + annual rate)^(1/12) - 1.
Calculate monthly interest rate: monthly interest rate = (1 + 0.105)^(1/12) - 1. This equals approximately 0.00836 or 0.836%.
For an annuity due, payments occur at the start of each period. The present value of an annuity due can be found using the formula PV = Pmt × [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r] × (1 + r), where Pmt is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the total number of payments.
Substituting the values: Pmt = $170, r = 0.00836, and n = 60 months (for 5 years). Calculate present value.
Compute PV: PV = 170 × [(1 - (1 + 0.00836)^-60) / 0.00836] × (1 + 0.00836). This gives approximately PV = 8,654.32."
10,"Sam wants to save money to open a tutoring center. He buys an annuity with a quarterly payment of $75 that pays 3% interest compounded quarterly. Payments will be made at the end of each quarter. Find the total value of the annuity in seven years.

Purpose of an Annuity:
An annuity is a flexible financial instrument with multiple uses, but its main objective is to offer a reliable source of income in retirement. Because of its tax-deferred growth feature, earnings will compound more quickly over time. Retirement planning can be stable and protected from asset outliving due to this consistent income. Annuities can also reduce market volatility, diversify sources of income, and provide advantages for long-term care planning. By enabling beneficiaries to receive any remaining funds after the annuitant's death, they also help facilitate legacy planning. Annuities are useful instruments for long-term financial objectives such as retirement planning since they are generally intended to offer stability, financial security, and peace of mind.","$2,100.35","$2,450.50","$2,327.12","$2,600.75",C,"Given information,

Amount of payment made for the annuity at the end of each quarter = $75
Annual interest rate = 3%
The interest is compounded quarterly.
Duration of the purchased annuity = 7 years.
Since the annuity requires an equal amount of payment to be made at the end of each quarter consecutively over the next 7 years, this cash flow series represents an ordinary annuity.

The total accumulated value of the annuity at the end of 7 years can be calculated using the following future value of an ordinary annuity formula:

{eq}FV_{Ordinary\ Annuity} = P\times \dfrac{(1+i)^n-1}{i} {/eq}

Where,

FV = Future accumulated value of the annuity
P = payment per period
i = interest rate per period
n = number of periods of payment
In the above-given problem,

By putting the corresponding values in the above formula, we get:

{eq}\begin{align*} FV &= $75 \times \dfrac{(1+0.0075)^{28}-1}{0.0075}\\ &=$75\times 31.02823301\\ &=$2,327.12\\ \end{align*} {/eq}



Thus, the total value of the annuity in seven years is $2,327.12.",C,"The formula to calculate the future value of an ordinary annuity is given by FV = P * [(1 + r)^nt - 1] / r, where P is the payment amount per period, r is the interest rate per period, n is the number of compounding periods per year, and t is the number of years.
In this problem, the annuity has a payment of P = $75 per quarter. The interest rate r per quarter is 3% annually compounded quarterly, which is 0.03 / 4 = 0.0075. The number of periods n per year is 4, and the total time t is 7 years.
Plug these values into the formula to find the future value. Thus, it becomes FV = 75 * [(1 + 0.0075)^(4*7) - 1] / 0.0075.
Calculate the expression inside the brackets: (1 + 0.0075)^(4*7). This becomes (1.0075)^28.
Calculate (1.0075)^28 ≈ 1.228146.
Subtract 1 from the value obtained: 1.228146 - 1 = 0.228146.
Divide this result by 0.0075: 0.228146 / 0.0075 ≈ 30.4195.

Individual Retirement Account (IRA):
One form of investing account that people can utilize to accumulate tax-advantaged money for retirement is an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Because IRAs are created and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses, they provide people more control over the money they save for retirement. The IRA is largely intended for use by independent contractors who lack access to corporate retirement plans, such the 401(k), which are solely offered by employers. However, anyone who has access to a workplace retirement plan can also open an IRA and use it to make additional savings investments. An IRA account can be opened through a bank, financial firm, internet brokerage, or personal broker.","$3,622","$5,281",$75,"$1,497",D,"We are given the following data:

The future value of Gina Dare's retirement savings = $1,000,000
The annual rate of return earned by an IRA account = 11.5%.
Time to retirement = 40 years
This problem tells us that Gina plans to deposit equal amounts of money at regular intervals into an IRA account. She'll make one deposit at the end of each year over the next 40 years with the goal of accumulating $1 million for retirement. This cash flow represents an ordinary annuity because a fixed amount is invested at the end of each consecutive period.

The amount of money Gina is required to invest annually can be calculated using the following future value of ordinary annuity formula:

{eq}\rm FV_{Ordinary\ Annuity}=P\times \dfrac{(1+r)^n-1}{r} {/eq}, where:

{eq}\rm FV = \text{Future accumulated value of Gina's retirement savings}=$1,000,000 {/eq}

The amount of money Gina needs to invest at the end of each year over the next 40 years is (D) $1,497.34.",D,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the future value of an annuity. Gina plans to deposit a certain amount annually that will grow to $1,000,000 in 40 years at an annual interest rate of 11.5%.
The future value of an annuity formula is: FV = Pmt * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r, where FV is the future value, Pmt is the annual payment, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years.
We need to solve for Pmt, the annual deposit. Rearrange the formula: Pmt = FV / [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r.
Substitute the given values into the formula: FV = 1,000,000, r = 0.115, and n = 40.
Calculate the future value component: (1 + 0.115)^40 - 1. This calculates the growth of 1 dollar.
(1 + 0.115)^40 = 70.9627 (rounded to four decimal places), so (1 + 0.115)^40 - 1 = 69.9627.
Now divide by the rate: 69.9627 / 0.115 = 608.2861.
Now, divide the target future value by this result: 1,000,000 / 608.2861 = 1,643.31 (round to the nearest dollar).

Annuity Account:
An annuity account is a type of financial instrument that investment firms and insurance companies generally offer. It entails a number of equal payments made on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. These payments, which offer a steady income stream, can be issued for a predetermined amount of time or the entirety of the account holder's life.

Annuity accounts can be used for a number of things, including retirement planning and securing a consistent income stream for a predetermined amount of time. They are frequently used to augment other income sources like Social Security or pensions in order to guarantee a consistent flow of funds during retirement.

The present value of the retirement amount is $193,912.70.



Step - 2: Computation of the first year savings amount

To accumulate $4.5 million for retirement after 35 years, a fixed percentage of the salary is saved and invested at the end of each year.
Again, the annual salary will increase at a rate of 3% per year.
To calculate the amount of money that is invested at the end of the first year we can use the following present value of a growing ordinary annuity formula:

{eq}PV = P \times \dfrac{1 - \left(\dfrac{(1+g)^n}{(1+r)^n }\right)}{r-g}\\ {/eq}

The portion of the salary that is saved at the end of the first year is $14,122.87.



Step - 3: Computation of the constant salary percentage that is saved every year

Amount of money saved at the end of the first year = $14,122.87.

Given a loan that is being repaid with regular equal payments over a period of time, it is possible to determine the new present value of the loan if an extra payment is made after a certain point.

P is the present value of the loan
R is the regular payment amount
i is the periodic interest rate
n is the total number of payments


We are given that the loan was set up to be paid off over 19 years. To determine the new present value P (amount still owed) after 4 years, we note that there are 15 years remaining.

Then, we have the following values:

R = $1,000
i = 7.1% = 0.071
n = 15 years


Thus, the new present value of the loan after 4 years is:

Next, when the extra payment of $2,000 is made, the present value is reduced to P = $7,050.66. Also, the number of remaining annual payments is reduced from 15 to 13. This produces the following values:

P = $7,050.66
i = 0.071
n = 13


Then, the new annual payment amount may be found by solving for R in the formula:

Assuming an equal amount of money, i.e., $200 is deposited at the end of each month into the savings account for the next 9 months, this cash flow series represents an ordinary annuity. The savings account balance after 9 months can be estimated using the following future value of an ordinary annuity formula:

{eq}FV_{Ordinary\ Annuity}=PMT \times \dfrac{(1+r)^n-1}{r} {/eq}

Where,

FV = Future value or balance of the savings account
PMT = payment per period = $200
{eq}r = \text{interest rate per period or monthly interest rate} =\dfrac{APR}{12}=\dfrac{0.07}{12}=0.0058333333 {/eq}
n = number of periods of payments = 9 months
By putting the corresponding values in the above-mentioned formula, we get:

{eq}\begin{align*} FV &= $200 \times \dfrac{(1+0.0058333333)^9-1}{0.0058333333}\\ &=$200\times 9.212883489\\ &=$1,842.58\\ \end{align*} {/eq}

So, in this case, {eq}n=360 {/eq}

Since it is not explicitly mentioned in the question, we consider the rate of interest of 5% offered on the account to be an annual rate rather than a monthly rate. The monthly deposits require the calculations to be using a monthly rate of interest. So, {eq}r=\dfrac{0.05}{12}=0.004167 {/eq}

Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate by dividing by 12. The annual interest rate is 5%, therefore the monthly interest rate is 5% / 12 = 0.4167% or 0.004167 in decimal.
Calculate the total number of deposits: 12 deposits a year for 30 years, which equals 360 deposits.

Future Value of an Annuity Due:
The total accumulated value of a series of cash payments made at the start of each pay period at a specific date in the future is determined by the future value of an annuity due formula. It helps ascertain the cash flow potential of a financial investment. The formula includes three variables: the amount of payment per period, the number of periods of payments and the interest rate per period.","$1,082.12","$1,075.50","$1,088.45","$1,095.67",A,"The amount of money in your account on January 01, 2012 = $1,082.12.



Given information,

The amount of money deposited on January 01, 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively is $333.33.
The account earns an interest rate of 8% compounded annually.
Since an equal amount of money is deposited at the beginning of each year for three years consecutively, this cash flow represents an annuity due.

The future value of an annuity due is calculated using the following formula:

{eq}FV_{Annuity\ due}=PMT \times \dfrac{(1+r)^n-1}{r}\times(1+r) {/eq}

Where,

PMT = payment per period =$333.33
r = interest rate per period =0.08
n = number of periods = 2


As per the above-given problem, we are required to calculate the amount of money that you will have in your account on January 01, 2012.
Since $333.33 is deposited at the beginning of each of the above-given 3 consecutive years, it's an annuity due.
First, we need to calculate the accumulated future value of the two deposits of $333.33 made on January 01, 2010, and 2011, respectively, on January 01, 2012. Then, the estimated future value is added to the amount deposited on January 01, 2012, i.e., $333.33 to get the final account balance.
The future value calculation is shown below:

{eq}\begin{align*} FV &= $333.33\times \dfrac{(1+0.08)^2-1}{0.08}\times (1+0.08)\\ &=$333.33\times2.08\times1.08\\ &=$748.792512\\ \end{align*} {/eq}



The future value of the two consecutive deposits of $333.33 made in 2010, and 2011, on January 01, 2012, is $748.792512.



Therefore, the amount of money you will have in your account on January 01, 2012, is

To find the future value of these deposits, we treat it as an annuity due where payments are made at the start of each period.
The future value of an annuity due is given by FVA = P * [(1 + r)^n - 1] * (1 + r) / r. However, since we have equal payments, we handle each deposit separately.
The first deposit is $333.333 on January 1, 2010, which will be held for 2 years. The future value is: $333.333 * (1.08)^2.
Calculate the increase for the first deposit: $333.333 * (1.08)^2 = 333.333 * 1.1664 = 388.80 approximately.
The second deposit is $333.333 on January 1, 2011, and compounds for 1 year: $333.333 * (1.08)^1.
Calculate the future value for the second deposit: $333.333 * (1.08) = 333.333 * 1.08 = 360.00 approximately.
The third deposit is $333.333 on January 1, 2012, and does not compound further since it is the end-point value.
Now, add the future values of all deposits: 388.80 (first deposit) + 360.00 (second deposit) + 333.333 (third deposit).
Evaluate the sum: 388.80 + 360.00 + 333.333 = 1,082.13

Amanda will start withdrawing money a year after she turns 65.
Since Amanda intends to withdraw an equal amount of money from her retirement account at the end of each year over a period of 30 years after she turns 65, this cash flow series represents an ordinary annuity.

The problem requires calculating the present value of an annuity. The yearly withdrawal is $25,000, the expected rate of return is 7% per year, and the number of years for the withdrawals is 30.
The formula for the present value of an annuity is: PV = PMT × [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r] where PV is the present value, PMT is the annual withdrawal ($25,000), r is the annual interest rate (0.07), and n is the number of periods (30).

In an ordinary annuity the payments are made at the end of each period. In contrast, in an annuity due the payments are made at the start of each period.

First, we need to adjust the annual interest rate of 3.21% to a monthly interest rate. This is done by dividing by 12 months. Monthly interest rate = 3.21% / 12 = 0.2675% per month or 0.002675 in decimal form.
There are 4 years, and since payments are monthly, that makes it 4 * 12 = 48 payments in total.
Now, we use the formula for present value of an annuity due, which is: PV = Pmt * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r] * (1 + r), where Pmt is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
Substitute the values into the formula: PV = 900 * [(1 - (1 + 0.002675)^-48) / 0.002675] * (1 + 0.002675).
Calculate (1 + 0.002675)^-48. This is the compounding factor over 48 months at a rate of 0.002675.
Calculate the annuity factor: [(1 - 0.875002) / 0.002675] = 46.38908.
Multiply the annuity factor by the monthly payment and adjust for annuity due (multiply by 1 + r): PV = 900 * 46.38908 * 1.002675 = $39,750.67."

Deferred Annuity:
A deferred annuity is a kind of annuity plan or policy offered by insurance companies that promise the investor to provide them with a set income starting at a future date of their choice, primarily after retirement. An investor can save during their working years and get income during retirement with deferred annuity programs. The annuity may pay a fixed amount of money at regular intervals or a lump sum in the future. Thus a deferred annuity can be divided into two phases: the accumulation phase and the withdrawal phase. In the accumulation phase, the investor adds money to the annuity account and the interest is deferred until the end of the accumulation phase. In the withdrawal phase, the annuity starts paying money to the investor.","$200,543.25","$202,145.00","$204,789.33","$206,123.45",B,"Given data,

Annuity payment per period = $3,500
Annuity amount is paid at the end of every month
Interest rate on annuity = 2.75% compounded semi-annually
The first withdrawal is to be made in 5 years and 1 month.


To find out the amount of money Kay paid to purchase the annuity, we need to determine the present value of the annuity.
Since the annuity pays an equal amount of money at the end of every month for 6 years, it's an ordinary annuity.
The present value of the given annuity can be determined through the following steps:

Step - 1: Computation of the interest rate compounded monthly

Since the compounding frequency of the given interest rate is semi-annual but the frequency of money withdrawal from the annuity is monthly, we need to first convert the compounding frequency into monthly using the following formula:

{eq}i =q\times \left[\left(1+\dfrac{r}{m}\right)^{m/q}-1\right]\\ {/eq}

Where,

i = new interest rate with compounding frequency as monthly
r = interest rate compounded semi-annually = 0.275
m = old compounding frequency i.e. semi-annually = 2
q = new compounding frequency i.e. monthly = 12
By putting the corresponding values in the above formula, we get:

{eq}\begin{align*} i &=12\times \left[\left(1+\dfrac{0.0275}{2}\right)^{2/12}-1\right]\\ &=12\times[1.002278647-1]\\ &=0.027343759\\ &=2.7343759\%\\ \end{align*} {/eq}



Thus, the equivalent interest rate compounded monthly is 2.73% (rounded off to two decimal places).



Step - 2: Computation of the present value of the deferred annuity

Since the withdrawal of money from the given annuity doesn't start immediately and is deferred by 5 years and 1 month, we need to determine the present value of the ordinary annuity by using the following formula:

{eq}PV_{Ordinary\ Annuity}=PMT\times \dfrac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{(1+r)^t\times r} {/eq}

Where,

{eq}PMT = \text{annuity payment per period} = $3,500\\ r = \text{monthly interest rate on the annuity} = \dfrac{0.0273}{12}=0.002275\\ n = \text{number of periods of payment} = 6\times 12=72\\ t = \text{number of periods of deferral} = \text{5 years and 1 month} = 61\ months {/eq}



By putting the corresponding values in the above formula, we get:

{eq}\begin{align*} PV &= $3,500\times \dfrac{1-(1+0.00275)^{-72}}{(1+0.00275)^{61}\times 0.00275}\\ &=$3,500\times \dfrac{0.150930266}{0.0026132573}\\ &=$3,500\times 57.755608\\ &=$202,144.63\\ \end{align*} {/eq}



Therefore, the present value of the given deferred ordinary annuity is $202,145 (rounded off).",C,"The annuity provides monthly payments of $3,500 at the end of every month for 6 years. This means there are a total of 6 x 12 = 72 payments.
The annuity is deferred for 5 years and 1 month. The interest rate given is 2.75% compounded semi-annually.
To calculate the present value of this annuity, we need to discount the payments back to the present value at the start of these 5 years and 1 month.
First, we calculate the number of compounding periods: Since it's compounded semi-annually, and each year has 2 periods, the 5 years and 1 month is equivalent to 10 + (1/6 of a period), approximately 10.167 periods.
Conversion of nominal rate to effective semi-annual interest rate: The nominal annual rate is 2.75%, so the semi-annual rate is 2.75% / 2 = 1.375%.
Convert the effective interest rate to monthly, as the payments are monthly. The approximate monthly rate can be considered since semi-annual compounding leads to minimal differences when converted manually.
Using the annuity present value formula, we need to apply the formula: PV = Pmt x [1 - (1 + i)^-n] / i, where n is total number of funds distributed, i is the interest rate.
We calculate the present value of these 72 monthly payments of $3500, discounted at the monthly converted interest rate, then further discounted them back through the deferred period of 5 years and 1 month.
Through these calculations, Kay pays $204,789.33 as the purchase price of the deferred annuity."

Let {eq}P {/eq} dollars be the periodic payment for the future value of {eq}FV=\$850,000 {/eq}. The annual rate of interest is {eq}r=6.8\%=0.068 {/eq}. The rate of interest is compounded quarterly. So, the interest rate per quarter is {eq}r=\dfrac{0.068}{4}=0.017 {/eq}.

There are four quarters in one year. So, there will be {eq}4 \times 10=44 {/eq} quarters in 10 years. So, the number of periods is {eq}n=44 {/eq}.

First payment = $50,000 paid immediately on winning the lottery
Present value is the value of future cash flows discounted at the given discount rates. Here, $50,000 is received immediately, so there is no need to discount this amount; this is the present value. Thus, $50,000 is added to the discounted cashflows to calculate the total present value of cash flow streams.

Calculation of present value of cash flow streams:

A) At a 7% discount rate:

{eq}\begin{aligned} \text{Present}\ \text{value of cash flows} &=\text{First}\ \text{payment}+\text{Annual payment}\times \frac{1-\left( \frac{1}{{{\left( 1+\text{Discount rate} \right)}^{\text{Period}}}} \right)}{\text{Discount rate}} \\ &=\$50,000+\$50,000\times \frac{1-\left( \frac{1}{{{\left( 1+7\% \right)}^{19}}} \right)}{7\%} \\ &=\$50,000+\$50,000\times \frac{1-0.2765083330}{7\%} \\ &=\$50,000+\$50,000\times \frac{0.7234916670}{7\%} \\ &=\$50,000+\$50,000\times 10.3355952 \\ &=\$50,000+\$516,779.76 \\ &=\$566,779.76 \end{aligned} {/eq}",C,"The lottery payout involves 20 installments: one initial payment and 19 subsequent annual payments. The initial payment of $50,000 is already present (at year 0), so its present value is simply $50,000.
The rest of the stream involves 19 payments occurring at the end of each of the next 19 years. This is an annuity with a payment of $50,000 per year. To find the present value of this annuity, we can apply the present value of annuity formula.
The present value of an annuity formula is PV = Pmt * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r], where Pmt = $50,000, r = 0.07 (7% discount rate), and n = 19. Let's calculate it step-by-step.
First, calculate (1 + r)^-n. We have (1 + 0.07)^-19. The result is approximately 0.2584.
Next, substitute into 1 - (1 + r)^-n = 1 - 0.2584 = 0.7416.
Now, substitute into the full formula for the annuity's present value: PV = $50,000 * [0.7416 / 0.07].
Calculating the division yields 0.7416 / 0.07 ≈ 10.5943. Then multiply by $50,000.
The present value of the annuity portion is $50,000 * 10.5943 ≈ $529,715.
To find the total present value of the cash flows, add the present value of the initial $50,000 payment to the present value of the annuity of remaining payments: $50,000 + $529,715.
Calculate the total present value: $50,000 + $529,715 = $579,715.
Round or adjust the calculation result to match one of the choices provided. The closest option to $579,715 is option C: $580,450.00."

First, let's calculate the factor: (1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r. Substitute the values: r = 0.09, n = 10. The factor becomes: (1 - (1 + 0.09)^-10) / 0.09.
Calculate (1 + r)^-n: (1 + 0.09)^-10 = (1.09)^-10.
Compute the value for (1.09)^-10 using a calculator: (1.09)^-10 = 0.42241.
Substitute back to compute the factor: (1 - 0.42241) / 0.09 = 0.57759 / 0.09.
Calculate the value of the factor: 0.57759 / 0.09 = 6.41767

The value of the annuity will be it present value.

To calculate the value of the annuity, we will calculate the cumulative present value factor first.

{eq}\text{Cumulative present value factor} = \dfrac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{\frac{i}{1 + i}} {/eq}

where,

i = interest rate

n = number of years

Here,

i = 6.25%

n = 6 years

Putting values, we get -

{eq}\begin{align} \text{Cumulative present value factor} &= \dfrac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{\frac{i}{1 + i}}\\ &= \dfrac{1 - (1 + 0.0625)^{-6}}{\frac{0.0625}{1 + 0.0625}}\\ &= \dfrac{1 - (1.0625)^{-6}}{\frac{0.0625}{1.0625}}\\ &= 5.18387\\ \end{align} {/eq}

Annuity:
When studying investment, the annuity becomes the most critical topic to be discussed. It is a series of payments that are paid after certain intervals.
