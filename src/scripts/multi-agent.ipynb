Amortization allocates the cost of the asset over its useful life.

The asset is sold for $15,000, which is less than the book value, resulting in a loss. The loss is calculated as the book value minus the sale price, which is $16,000 - $15,000 = $1,000.

The book value of the machines sold is the difference between the original cost and the accumulated depreciation. Since the accumulated depreciation increased by $100 (from $1,300 to $1,400), this suggests that the book value of the machines sold was $100.

      "{'answer': 'C', 'feedback': \"The straight-line depreciation method spreads the cost of the asset evenly over its useful life. The van's cost is $45,000, and its residual value is $5,500, so the depreciable amount is $45,000 - $5,500 = $39,500. Over 5 years, the annual depreciation is $39,500 / 5 = $7,900. By December 31, 2014, the van has been depreciated for 4 years, so the accumulated depreciation is 4 * $7,900 = $31,600.

      "{'answer': 'A', 'feedback': 'When a building is sold for cash, the cash account is debited because cash is an asset that is increasing. The building account is credited because it is an asset that is decreasing. Therefore, the journal entry involves debiting the cash account.'}\n",

      "{'answer': 'D', 'feedback': 'Intangible assets typically include non-physical assets such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill. These are assets that do not have a physical presence but provide value to the company. Inventory, on the other hand, is a physical asset and is classified as a current asset on the balance sheet, not an intangible asset. Therefore, inventory would not be included as an intangible asset on the balance sheet.'}\n",

This includes the purchase price, sales taxes, and the cost of painting the logo. The annual license and safety testing are not included in the capitalized cost.

      "{'answer': 'A', 'feedback': 'According to the cost principle in accounting, assets should be recorded at their cost at the time of acquisition, not at their market value. Therefore, the plant asset should be recorded at the amount paid, which is $11,000.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'feedback': 'Depreciation is typically calculated on a pro-rata basis for the portion of the year that the asset was in use. This means that if an asset is disposed of during the year, depreciation is calculated only for the months it was in service before disposal.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'feedback': 'Liquidity refers to how quickly and easily an asset can be converted into cash without significantly affecting its price. Therefore, liquidity is a measure of how easily assets can be converted into cash.'}\n",

      "{'answer': 'B', 'feedback': \"In a basket purchase, the total purchase price is allocated to the individual assets based on their relative fair values. The total fair value of the land and buildings is $1,200,000 + $600,000 = $1,800,000. The allocation for the land is ($1,200,000 / $1,800,000) * $1,500,000 = $1,000,000, and for the buildings is ($600,000 / $1,800,000) * $1,500,000 = $500,000.
