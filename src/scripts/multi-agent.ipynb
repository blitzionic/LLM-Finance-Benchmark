      " Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of a company's profitability that calculates how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing net income by shareholder's equity. ROE can be broken down into several components using an extended version of the Du Pont formula, which includes the leverage ratio, asset turnover, operating profit margin, and debt burden. The leverage ratio reflects the firm's debt-equity mix, while the debt burden indicates how interest expenses affect net income. Leverage can impact ROE, potentially increasing it when the firm performs well and the return on assets exceeds the interest rate.\n",
